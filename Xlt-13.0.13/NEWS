Check out ChangeLog for long list of changes to this package.

Moved to a new CVS !
	See http://sourceforge.net/projects/xlt

Changed the API of ListTree so it has Xlt prefixes everywhere.
	Previously it was just "ListTreeXXX()", now it's XltListTreeXXX().
	Add a call to open/close part of the tree.
	Add a resource (XltDefaultMode) to indicate whether the tree is
		open or closed by default.

Add the LiteClue widget.
