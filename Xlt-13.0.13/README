                   =================


XltBubbleButton - XmPushButton sub-class with tool-tips, bubble-help, 
	annoying clutter on the screen, or what ever it's called these days.

XltAnimatedButton - XltBubbleButton sub-class for displaying a sequence of
	Pixmaps, or XmStrings, as an animation.

XltEntrySB - A combination of an XmScale and XmTextField for numeric entry.

XltFilePicker - A combination XmLabel, XmTextField, and XltBubbleButton that
	pops up an XmFileSelectionDialog and displays the selection.

XltHost - an object sub-class that opens a TCP/IP stream and returns the
	data from the stream with callbacks.

XltNumEntry - An XmLabel, XmTextField and a couple of XmArrowButtons for 
	numeric data entry.  This has a built in calculator, so you can
	enter "4 * sin(PI)" as "4 * sin(PI)" instead of ".2192".  It's
	pretty cool, if I do say so myself.

SciPlot - plotting widget.

Strokes - The next thing in UI design, available here first!  Beats "themes"
	hands down, this is actually usefull!

XltDisplayFallbackResources - A function to print the compiled in FallBack
	resources to stderr in a resource file format.

XltDisplayOptions - A function to print the command line options to stderr.

XltHostTranscript - A function to create a dialog that displays all incoming
	data on a Host stream in an XmScrolledText widget.

XltRedirectStdErr - A function that captures stderr and displays it in a
	dialog.

XltSetClientIcon - A function to set the ApplicationShell iconPixmap and
	iconMask with the xpm data.

Sound - Easily add actions and resources to play sound files.

XltTooBarAddItem - A function that makes it easy to add XltBubbleButtons that
	display xpm icons to an XmRowColumn, for use as a tool bar.

XltWorking - Pops up a dialog that displays the percentage of a task complete
	without having to convert the task to a WorkProc, and without haveing
	to worry about un-managing the dialog before it is actually mapped.

XltYesNo - An "in-line" dialog for simple questions.

XltAppShell - A drop-in replacement for Xt's applicationShell
      which makes supporting private colormaps and non-default visual a no-brainer.
