.SH DESCRIPTION
.fi
\fIXltWorking\fP 
Creates a dialog containing a message string, a bar showing the percentage
of the task complete, and an abort button. When called with a percent_done
value of zero the dialog is managed, and a timer installed to update the bar
every second. If question is not NULL, the message string in the dialog is
set to this. When called with a percent_done of 100, the dialog is un-managed.
If called with a percent_done of -1, only the message is changed. Any value
between 0 and 100 will cause the bar graph to be updated the next time the 
timer fires, and processes any pending timer and X events. If the return value
is True, the user has requested that the task should be aborted.
.IP "\fBwidget\fP"
The widget to wait for.
.IP "\fBquestion\fP"
The message to display in the working dialog. Or NULL, meaning no change.
.IP "\fBpercent_done\fP"
The percentage of the task complete. 0 will cause the dialog to be managed.
100 will cause the dialog to be un-managed. -1 will update the question only.
Any value between 0 and 100 will update the bar graph.
.PP 
.SH RETURN VALUE
Boolean, if True the abort button was pushed, or the window was closed by the
window manager.
