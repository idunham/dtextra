</a></H3>
<br><p><p align=center><IMG src="LiteClue.gif"><p><p>LiteClue is a widget 
which pops a one line help 
message when the user passes the pointer over another &quot;watched&quot; widget.  This is 
known by various names in the industry such as hints, clues, tips 
and balloon help.  
<p>Clues are particularly helpful for push buttons that contain graphic 
pixmaps rather than text.  They obviate the need to place text within graphics 
in the button which creates internationalization problems.  
A clue may be attached to virtually any widget that has a window (no gadgets).  
LiteClue does not require Motif 
<p>None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself.  
LiteClue monitors enter and leave events of the watched widget's 
window passively.  
<p>LiteClue inherits behaviour and ewsources from OverrideShell.  
<p>The class pointer is xcgLiteClueWidgetClass.  
<p>The class name is xcgLiteClue.

</a></H3>
<br><p>LiteClue contains the following functions that control the widget behaviour.  
<p><H3><a name="H7.1">7.1 XcgLiteClueAddWidget -- Add a widget to be watched.  
</a></H3>
<br><DL><DT>
<b>Function</b> 
<DD>
 
A widget will be added to the LiteClue watched list.  
Clues are given for sensitive watched widgets when the pointer enters its 
window.  If the widget is already watched, the passed text replaces its 
current clue text.  
If text is null, the widget is still added, if it is not already 
in the list, but no clue will appear.  Text may be specified 
with XcgLiteClueAddWidget in a subsequent call.  
When text is null and the widget is already in the list, its 
text is not changed.  
When a widget will is added to the watched list, it automatically 
becomes sensitive.  Otherwise, its sensitivity is not changed.  
A watched widget which is not sensitive retains its context but clues 
are suppressed.  
None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself.  
LiteClue monitors enter and leave events of the watched widget's 
window passively.

</a></H3>
<br><p><DL><DT>
<b>Function</b> 
<DD>
A widget is deleted from the watched list and its resources are 
freed.  LiteClue is no longer given for the widget.  
If the widget is not watched, nothing is done.  
None of this affects the behaviour of the watched widget itself, just whether 
a clue is poped for the widget.

<DD>
When a watched widget is sensitive, a clue is poped up when the 
pointer enters its window.  When a watched widget is insensitive, 
the widget is retained in the watched list but no clue is poped.  
The sensitivity of a watched widget relative to clues is set or reset 
by this function.  
The Xt sensitivity of the watched widget is not altered by this function.

pointer enters its window.  When a watched widget is insensitive, 
the widget is retained in the watched list but no clue is poped.  
The sensitivity state of a watched widget relative to clues is returned 
by this function.

</a></H3>
<br><p>The LiteClue widget is designed to allow the display of internationalized 
text.  This has been tested on a limited basis with Japanese.  
<p>In order to make use of internationalization, you must have support 
in your operating system for the desired locale and must have the 
needed fonts.  In some cases, you may use the X provided locale 
support instead.  At initialization, you should have code that 
looks something like: 
<p><pre>
	if (setlocale(LC_ALL,&quot;&quot;) == NULL)
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: Can't set locale\n&quot;);
	if (!XSupportsLocale())
	{
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: X does not support locale\n&quot;);
		setlocale(LC_ALL,NULL) ;
	}
	if (XSetLocaleModifiers(&quot;&quot;) == NULL)
		fprintf(stderr, &quot;LiteCluetest: Can't XSetLocaleModifiers\n&quot;);
</pre><p>If you need the X locale package, add the following: 
<p><pre>
	#define X_LOCALE
	#include &lt;X11/Xlocale.h&gt;
</pre><p><br>LiteClue makes use of the XR5 Font Set technology.  All 
font resources are converted to Font Sets.  For example, for Japanese 
you will need three fonts for each font set: 
<p><pre>
*normalFont: \
-sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-110-100-100-c-0-jisx0201.1976-0,\
-adobe-new century schoolbook-medium-r-normal-*-14-*,\
-jis-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1983-0

*h1Font: \
-sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-170-100-100-c-0-jisx0201.1976-0,\
-adobe-new century schoolbook-bold-r-normal-*-24-*,\
-jis-fixed-medium-r-normal--24-170-100-100-c-240-jisx0208.1983-0

! etc for each font resource
</pre><p>Finally, you must set the environment symbol LANG to the appropriate locale.  
For Japanese, one possibility is &quot;LANG=ja_JP.eucJP&quot;.
