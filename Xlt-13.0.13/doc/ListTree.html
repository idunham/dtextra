<p><hr><h2><a name="new"><img src=new.gif align=bottom alt="[New!]">Important version 3.0 changes</a></h2>

<p>The ListTree is now entirely Motif/LessTif based!  Due to my involvement
with the <a href="http://www.hungry.com/products/lesstif">LessTif project</a>,
it only operates as a child of an XmScrolledWindow.  (I think
that standardization on one user interface for unix is necessary for the
survival of our favorite class of operating system, but that's another
discussion. :)

<p>One of the most important changes (besides the Motif dependency)
is that Version 3 doesn't suffer from the ~64,000 pixel limit height of an X11
widget.  This version only draws items that are shown in the window, rather
than rendering the entire list while clipping to the visible window.

<p>All features from version 2.0 have been retained, and many new features
have been added.  New features include the ability to specify pixmaps on
a per-item basis, and multiple discontinuous select.  To be added before
the final version 3 release will be keyboard traversal.

<p><hr><h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The ListTree Widget is small list widget capable of displaying lists of
text strings (with an optional pixmap) in a heirarchal directory list sort
of format.  Unlike all of the other freely available tree widgets that I could
find, this widget does not use widgets for each item displayed in the tree.
Instead, it is a list of text strings that contain pointers to parents and
children in the tree.  This reduces memory usage over widget tree widgets, and
also simplifies use.

<p>This widget was designed for use in file manager type programs, so an
optional pixmap is available for displaying to the left of the text item.  The
pixmap has an open and closed state, and different types of pixmaps are
available for items with and without children.  Currently, pixmaps for
different file types are not available.

<p>The lists are activated by clicking the left mouse button on the Pixmap
of the item, or double clicking ond the name of the item.  The state of the
item is then toggled, and if the item is open, its children are displayed.
Ranges of items can also be toggled by clicking and dragging the left mouse
button over the names of the items you want to highlight.

<p><hr><h2><a name="feat">Features</a></h2>

<p><hr><h2><a name="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>The ListTree code requires X11R5 or later and an ANSI C compiler.  The
code may compile on a non-ANSI compiler if it supports new style function
definitions.

<p>The widget now requires Motif or
<a href="ftp://ftp.hungry.com/pub/lesstif/">LessTif</a>.

<p><hr><h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>

<p>This code was originally developed on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 4.1
and X11R5.  Version 2.0 was developed on a Linux machine running kernel
1.3.* and XFree86 3.1.2 (X11R6).  Version 3.0 was developed on Linux 2.0
using the LessTif toolkit.  It
was also tested on two other machines: a DEC Alpha/AXP running OSF/1 3.0
with X11R5; and an SGI Indigo running IRIX 4.0.5 with X11R4.

<p><hr><h2><a name="note">Author's Note</a></h2>

<p>This widget is supplied as freeware, in the hope that it will be useful for
developers in the X community.  If you do use this widget, I do request that
you include mention of the ListTree widget in the documentation.  Also,
remember to include a copy of the entire copyright and permission notice!
Thanks.

<p>Patches, improvements, suggestions, bug reports, job offers, volleyball
games, and money you love donating to programmers who make your life <b>so</b>
much easier are welcome at <tt>&lt;rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu&gt;</tt>.
I will periodically post patches and improvements to ftp.x.org and the
ListTree web page at
