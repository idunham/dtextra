.SH DESCRIPTION
.fi
XltSelectionBox is just like XmSelectionBox except, as you type text into
the TextField widget the list magically scrolls to the closest match.

.SS "Classes"
XltSelectionBox inherits behavior and resources from the
\fICore\fP, \fIComposite\fP, \fIConstraint\fP, \fIXmManager\fP,
\fIXmBulletinBoard\fP, and
\fIXmSelectionBox\fP 
classes.
.PP 
The class pointer is \fIXltSelectionBoxWidgetClass\fP.
.PP 
The class name is \fIXltSelectionBox\fP.
.SS "New Resources"
The following table defines a set of widget resources used by the programmer
to specify data.  The programmer can also set the resource values for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget.  To reference a
resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults file, remove the \fIXmN\fP or
\fIXmC\fP prefix and use the remaining letters.  To specify one of the defined
values for a resource in a .Xdefaults file, remove the \fIXm\fP prefix and use
the remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but include any
underscores between words).
The codes in the access column indicate if the given resource can be
set at creation time (C),
set by using \fIXtSetValues\fP (S),
retrieved by using \fIXtGetValues\fP (G), or is not applicable (N/A).
