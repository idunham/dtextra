.SH DESCRIPTION
Enable Strokes to be recognized in the given widget. It first
retrieves the resources and installs an Xt event for button
press, release and, motion on the given widget and all of its
children.  Therefore this function should not be called until
all of the widgets children have been added.

.SS
.B Resources
Resources are specified as if they belong to the widget that
the strokes are enabled in.

.TP
.B strokes: stroke action [[,stroke action]...]
This provides a mapping of strokes to actions.  By default the
action `Stroke-456' is called for stroke `456'.

.TP
.B strokeSlop: int
This is used to define a buffer zone between the boxes of the grid.
The amount of slop tolerated is actually the resulting box dimension
divided by this slop number. Therefore the larger the slop number
the more accurate your strokes must be.  A value approaching 3 will
make it all but impossible to recognize a stroke.  The default value
is currently 20.
Run the stroke(1) program with StrokeDebug turned on to show what this
means.

.TP
.B strokeDebug: True | False
Turns on `stroke debug mode'.  In this mode the strokes are not erased
from the screen when the button is released and a grid is drawn around
the stroke.  Try the stroke(1) program to see what I mean.

.TP
.B strokeButton: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
Specifies the button to be used to draw strokes. By default Btn3
is used.

.TP
.B strokeSound: sound file
If given, the contents of this resource will be provided as
an argument to the `PlaySound' action at the conclusion of 
the stroke.  If the PlaySound action
is not defined in your application do not specify this resource.
Specifically the following call is made:

.nf
XtCallActionProc(W, "PlaySound", NULL, "sound file", 1);
