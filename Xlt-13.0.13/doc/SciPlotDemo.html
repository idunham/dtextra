<p><hr><h2><a name="comp">Compilation Instructions</a></h2>
<p>Shipped with the source code distribution are two demo programs
that show some of the features of the SciPlot widget.

<p>The tests are in <CODE>tests/SciPlot</CODE>.


<p><hr><h2><a name="sciplot">x/y plotter</a></h2>

<p>The SciPlot Demo program takes a text file (or standard input) as input
and plots the data from that file as x/y or polar plots.  More than one 
set of x/y (polar) line data may appear in a single plot frame, and more
than one plot frame may be displayed on the screen.  As shown in the
<a href="#screen">plot frame controls</a>
, many features of the SciPlot widget are available for customization before
generating a postscript copy.

<h3><a name="usage">Usage</a></h3>

<p>The SciPlot Demo program is made automatically when compiling the SciPlot
Widget source code, as shipped.  It is called "sciplot" and is executed by
typing:

<p><code>sciplot data.txt</code>

<p>where data.txt is a sciplot input file, described below.  Note that sciplot
can also read multiple input files on the same command line, or read from
standard input.

<h3><a name="data">Input File Format</a></h3>
<p>There are 5 commands that sciplot recognizes in the input file.  Optional
items are enclosed in [square brackets].

<dl>
<dt>Title [title]
<dd>Signifies the start of a new plot, and optionally specifies the title
for the plot.

<dt>Xaxis [x axis label]
<dd>Optional x axis label

<dt>Yaxis [y axis label]
<dd>Optional y axis label

<dt>Polar [rad]
<dd>Polar plot flag.  If not present, the form is assumed to be a cartesian
(x/y) plot.

<dt>Line legend-label
<dd>Begins a new line of data to be added to the current plot.  The values
to be added immediately follow this line in the input file; and the program
will continue to add lines until another command is reached, or the file ends.
<p>Data is free format, but must be separated by a comma, equal sign, or
whitespace.  Both the x and y (r and theta) coordinates must appear on the
same line of text in the file.
<p>In place of a line of x/y data, the keyword "skip" may be substituted.
This causes a break in the current line, which allows lines to contain
multiple disjointed line segments.
</dl>

<p>Any text labels in the file should be enclosed in quotation characters.

<p><hr><h2><a name="realtime">Realtime Demo</a></h2>
<p>This is just a simple program that uses the realtime updating capabilities
of the widget.  Instituted in the program is a timed callback
(XtAppAddTimeOut) that simply randomly increments one of the points every
half second.  The plot is redrawn after every update.

<h3><a name="realtime_usage">Usage</a></h3>
<p>Just execute the program "realtime" to see this demo.
It takes no arguments.
