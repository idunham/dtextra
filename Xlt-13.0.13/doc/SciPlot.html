<h1><a name="top">SciPlot Widget <img src=SciPlotTitle.gif></a></h1>

<p>A full-featured Xt widget to display 2D data in a graph.  
It is intended to display scientific data, and can format the data in polar or
cartesian plots (log axes available for cartesian plots).

<p><hr><h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The SciPlot Widget is a widget capable of plotting cartesian or polar graphs,
including logarithmic axes in cartesian plots.  The widget is subclassed
directly from the Core widget class, which means that it does not depend upon
any other widget set.  It may be freely used with Athena, Motif, or the
Open Look/Xview widget sets.  (There is optional Motif support that causes
the widget to be subclassed from XmPrimitive.  See the 
<a href="SciPlotProg.html">Programmer's Reference</a>
for more information.)

<p>Features provided in the widget include automatic scaling, legend drawing,
axis labeling, PostScript output, multiple plotted lines, color support, user
font specification, dashed lines, symbols drawn at points, logarithmic scales
on one or both axes in cartesian plots, and degrees or radians as angles in
polar plots.

<p><hr><h2><a name="feat">Features</a></h2>
<p>Features provided in the widget include the following:

<ul>
<li>Cartesian or Polar plots
<li>Automatic or manual axis scales
<li>Logarithmic scales for cartesian plot
<li>Degrees or radians for polar angles
<li>Axis labeling
<li>Legend drawing
<li>Multiple lines per plot
<li>Noncontinuous (broken) line segments
<li>Various symbols and line styles
<li>Color support
<li>User font selection
<li>PostScript (EPS) output in color or black &amp; white
<li>Real time updates
<li>Vertical or horizontal y axis label numbers
</ul>

<p>See the
<a href="SciPlotDemo.html">demo program information</a>
page for compilation instructions and sample programs.

<p><hr><h2><a name="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>The SciPlot code requires X11R5 or later and a C compiler.  The code was
designed using ANSI C, but compiles fine with a non-ANSI compiler if the
compiler can understand new-style function definitions.  The demo programs
also require Motif 1.2 or later.

<p><hr><h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>

<p>This code was originally developed on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.4 and
X11R5.  Currently, it is maintained on a Linux machine running kernel
1.3.* and XFree86 3.1.2 (X11R6).  It is regularly tested by myself on an
IBM RS/6000 running AIX 4.1 and a DEC Alpha/AXP running Digital UNIX
(formarly OSF/1) 3.2 with X11R5.  I have had reports of the widget running
successfully on many machines, including SGI, HP, Sun, Dec Ultrix, and even
a Dec OpenVMS machine.

<p>The vertical text drawing routine is based on the "fill stippled" idea that
I first saw in the code xvertext-5.0 by Alan Richardson
<tt>&lt;mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk&gt;</tt>.

<p>The first X11 plotting widget that I saw was the libXG package written by
Sundar Narasimhan <tt>&lt;sundar@ai.mit.edu&gt;</tt>.  The libXG plotting
widget Graph is based on a much more general widget called Display, which
provides device independent 2D (and 3D) graphics.

<p>My attempts to change the Graph widget to do what I liked it to do led me to
start from scratch and write this SciPlot widget.  I didn't need (or want) to
include the sort of functionality present in the Display widget, so I wrote
the SciPlot widget as a self-contained widget that uses printer points as
the basis of the graphics.  Nevertheless, some of the techniques that I used
are similar to those found in the Graph widget, so Sundar Narasimhan does
deserve mention for the excellent libXG package.

<p><hr><h2><a name="note">Author's Note</a></h2>

<p>This widget is supplied as freeware, in the hope that it will be useful for
developers in the X community.  If you do use this widget, I do request that
you include mention of the SciPlot widget in the documentation.  Also,
remember to include a copy of the entire copyright and permission notice!
Thanks.

<p>Patches, improvements, suggestions, bug reports, job offers, volleyball
games, and money you love donating to programmers who make your life <b>so</b>
much easier are welcome at <tt>&lt;rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu&gt;</tt>.
I will periodically post patches and improvements to ftp.x.org and the
SciPlot web page at http://www.ae.utexas.edu/~rwmcm/SciPlot.html
