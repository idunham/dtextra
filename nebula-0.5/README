NEBULA

an IRC client for X11 and Motif

-------------------------------


Nebula aims to be a graphical IRC client, aimed at the unix and compatible platforms and using the motif/openmotif or the lesstif ToolKit.
The goals are
- portability to various unix systems (planned are already Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Irix and AIX)
- small footprint and low system resource usage
- speed
- clear, non intrusive GUI
- security


TODO
- implement some sort of preferences for nickname and channel
- implement more CTCP commands
- implement channel operator commands
- add configure checks and guards for gethostname and sys/param.h (for the hostname stuff)
- add configure checks and potential workaround for uname call for system information (use ARCHOS)
