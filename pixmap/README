			Pixmap version 2.6 R4/R5/R6 version

WHAT IS Pixmap?
==============

Pixmap is a pixmap editor based on XPM version 3.4 library from
Arnaud Le Hors - GROUPE BULL, derived from Davor Matic's bitmap editor
(Davor Matic is member of the XConsortium AnneX).

Here is provided a program similar to the bitmap editor. As Bitmap, it
provides facilities to edit pixmaps stored in files in XPM 3 format.

NOTE: The XPM library is mandatory. You should have got and installed
it before proceeding.

See the Pixmap Manual (pixmap.man) for more details.

HOW TO GET Pixmap?
=================

New pixmap updates are announced on the comp.windows.x newsgroup, and
on the "pixmap" list. All new "official" pixmap releases can be
found by ftp on:

  ftp.x.org	 (198.112.44.100)  contrib/applications/pixmap	(Boston, USA)
  avahi.inria.fr (192.5.60.47)     pub/pixmap	(Sophia Antipolis, France)


DOCUMENTATION:
=============

Pixmap is not fully documented but is also self explanatory. A
Reference Card in LaTeX format is joined which contains the main
facilities of the editor: accelerator keys, resources, application
files, ... The rest of the information can be found in the manual file
pixmap.man.  We can mail you a PostScript version of the documentation
if you are not able to print it (quite impossible).

INSTALLATION:
============

To obtain the Pixmap editor program, first uncompress and untar the
compressed tar file (or unshar the shar file) in an approriate
directory.

Pixmap only compiles with Imake.
As Pixmap can have two different interfaces, based on Athena and
Motif, (see MOTIF DISCUSSION about Motif version) you should look at
the Imakefile to set the variables corresponding to the version you
wish to obtain. The default version is the Athena one.

The variable of interest is USE_MOTIF (#define or #undef it as you like).

You should also look at the lines concerning the Pixmap.ad file creation.

In any case, you should set up the XPM relative variables correctly.
These are XPM_INCLUDEDIR and XPM_LIBDIR.

You should also check the setting of APPDEFDIR and RGBF so that they
point to your site application defaults directory and rgb.txt file
(the latter is usually under $(LIBDIR)/rgb.txt with LIBDIR=/usr/lib/X11).

Double check the Imakefile and type:

	xmkmf -a
	make

which will build the pixmap program and its application defaults file. 
Then do:

     	make install
	make install.man

which will install the program, application defaults file, the pixmap
man page and the bitmaps used as image labels of buttons.

If it fails, you may edit the Imakefile to add compilation flags to
suit your machine.

NOTE: A sample dotpixmap file (color configuration file) is created by
the Makefile based on the rgb.txt file (RGBF variable). You can
extract parts of this file to build your own .pixmap file used by
Pixmap.

NOTE: This version is an intermediate between R4 and R5/R6. It provides
R5 include files missing in R4. Thus, if you are already running R5,
you can remove the files Xfuncs.h, Xosdefs.h and Xfuncproto.h under
pixmap/X11 directory.

CONVERTERS:
==========

In the Xmu directory you can find different converters about XPM.
These are converters that can be installed in an application to allow
specification of pixmap resources in .Xdefaults and application
default files.  No Makefile or Imakefile is provided to compile or
install them. However, someone is currently working on converters to
allow full use of the Xpm library features through resources.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
==============

The accelerators don't seem to work with Athena with X11R4.

Sometimes pixmap stops when not able to malloc memory after a few
loading ops. 

DISCUSSION:
==========

There is a mailing list to discuss about Pixmap which is 
pixmap@sophia.inria.fr.
