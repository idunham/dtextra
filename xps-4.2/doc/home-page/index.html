Process tree display and manipulation for the X Window System.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="20%">

<p>
The <B>xps</B> program displays and continuously updates in an X
Window the Unix processes as a tree or forest. The roots of the tree
are on the left-hand side and the leaf processes (with no children)
are on the right-hand side.  The status of each process (<font
color=green>running</font>, sleeping, <font color=red>stopped</font>,
etc.) can be indicated by a color.  Different users can appear as
different colors too.

<p>
Within each level, processes are grouped so that those with the same
parent process id are grouped together. Within this, processes are
arranged by userid with lower number uid's appearing towards the
top. In general, the order of children is the order in which they were
spawned, with the older processes appearing towards towards the top.

<p>
In contrast to <B>pstree</B> and many tree-widget based programs, the
overall tree display uses diagonal lines; some effort is made to
effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen by balancing
levels and centering the children of a node between their parent. A
goal of the program is to visually give a picture of what's going
on. So when possible processes are kept close to their parents so one
needn't scroll around too much and so that there isn't a lot of
redrawing as processes are created or destroyed.

<p>
One can click on a process to get more information (via <B>ps</B>) about
that process, send a signal to the process, or set its priority,
assuming you have the permission to do so.

Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their own, 
some effort has been made to turn off the update process when the
program is iconified or or not visible.

<p>
