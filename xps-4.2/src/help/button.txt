When a button is depressed (or looks depressed), the feature
described below is "on." The initial state of push buttons can 
be set by resources or command options. Toggle buttons and 
radio buttons are described below.

Beep: 
  The program can arrange to beep when the number of processes grows
  or diminishes. The keyboard-translation equivalent of this is
  "togglebeep()". The tune to play can be set by resources "beepup" 
  and "beepdown". 

Quick Kill: 
  The program can be arrange to point-and-kill processes. This 
  button is like the safety latch on the trigger. Also, the
  default behavior is to allow only the right mouse button in 
  this endeavor. (I am left-handed.)

  Depending on the shifting activity of proceses, you might have to be
  quick though to get the right one!

  The default behavior is to be nice to the process and send it a TERM
  signal. However serial killers and die-hard sysadmins can arrange
  for the default signal to be KILL (-9) or another signal using the
  L<Set Quick Kill> menu.

Kernel/All/User:
  The program can show all processes, all processes including kernel 
  processes or those associated with a particular userid or pattern. 
  Buttons may vary depending on the capabilities of your system.
  The keyboard-translation equivalent of this is
  C<toggleprocs()> and C<togglekernel()>. 

Zoom:
  The program maintains two windows, a "zoomed" or maximized window
  and a normal one. The geometry, text font, and scrollable canvas
  window can all be set independently for the zoomed and normal
  windows.  The keyboard-translation equivalent of this is "zoom()".
