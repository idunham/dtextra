When the C<All> radio button is depressed, the program generally shows
all processes.  It is possible that on some systems the program has
not been compiled in a way to show processes other than the ones you
own.  On some systems there is a C<Kernel> button as well and this
shows all proceses as well as additional kernel processes.

When the C<User> radio button is depressed, the program shows only
some portion of all the processes, initially the processes associated
with the userid that invokes the program. However you can change that
with the "Set Watch User" dialog box. 

On systems that have a regular-expression library and where the
program has been compiled to support patterns, there will be a
"pattern" toggle button which allows one to select a pattern for a
user name. See your system documentation for the your
regular-expression syntax. Selection by pattern match may slow the
program down a bit, so it should be used with caution for complex
patterns and systems with a very large number of processes.

When pattern-match selection is not indicated, the user name only
changes if the newly-entered one is a name known on the system.  When
pattern-match selection is indicated, the pattern changes if it is
syntactically correct. In case, if there is an error in entry the old
value is kept and method of matching (pattern-match or not) is kept.

It is possible to set the watch user for the zoomed and normal windows
separately. However if you want to change the view in both windows,
check the "Set both windows" box.
