The Set Refresh Rate Menu is used to set how frequently this program
should retrieve process information. The units displayed are in
seconds.

Changing the refresh rate does not have an immediate effect, but takes
effect the next time the polling occurs.

No matter what the refresh rate interval is set to, the display is
updated only when it is visible--this program can consume lots of CPU
time.
