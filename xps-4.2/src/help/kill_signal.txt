In the top line is a Kill toggle button for those of you who like to
massacre processes.

But in order for point-and-kill to work, one has to arrange in advance
what signal will be sent; that is what this menu is for.

In contrast to the signal menu found in the L<Process Dialog Box>,
there is no C<NO ACTION> signal. Also, this menu remembers the 
signal last used and has this selected in the menu list.
