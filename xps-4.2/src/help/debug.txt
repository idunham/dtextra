If you should be so unfortunate as to want to debug this program, you
can set this integer value and output should appear on stdout.  So if
you set debugging you should have some way to see stdout of this
program. For example running this command from a window menu is
probably a lose.

The debug value is interpreted as a bitstring, the individual bits
determine what's displayed. The bit values are:
   1  for callbacks and events handling
   2  for display debug messages 
   4  for menu-oriented messages
   8  for the virtual position in the tree-level 
  16  for tree sorting debugging messages 

Anybody wanna turn this menu into a nice checkbox menu?
