                   This can be positive or negative. A "tick" 
                   is defined when compiling the program as are 
                   the fastest and slowest value that can be set.
                   These values are displayed in info from the 
                   C<-version> option.

                   cursor.
showprocess(K)     Kill the process over the cursor, provided
                   L<Quick Kill> is set. Otherwise, the same as showprocess().

**togglebeep and togglekernel can also take single parameter with a
values of 0, 1, or 2; 0 means set the state off, 1 means set the state
on, and 2 toggle the state. So togglebeep() is the same as
togglebeep(2).
