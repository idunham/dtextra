It is possible if you don't have a prior installation xps or specify
--prefix that the prefix will be set incorrectly, especially if your
path contains directories that don't "bin."

We use an autoconf macro to guess where to install xps and the macro
can sometimes guess the wrong thing.

In particular, xterm on AIX is often accessible as /usr/bin/X11.  The
configure program may decide to try to put xps in the same place as
xterm (if you don't have xps already installed and don't have
xscreensaver installed either). Finding the program
"/usr/bin/X11/xterm" configure will strip off the trailing X11/xterm
leaving /usr/bin, and the xps binary will be put in /usr/bin/bin which
is probably not what you intended.

So do check what the prefix set is. "make -n install" to test out the
install is always a good idea.
