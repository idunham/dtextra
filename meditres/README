What is this about?
-------------------
I enhanced the program "editres" written by Cris D. Peterson, MIT X Consortium.
This version of editres is based on the sources from the X11R6(.0) contrib
directory (without I18N support, it will be added later). I am trying to add
new functionality and better "usability" to editres. This version of editres
is not complete but you can use a few of the new features I would like to add.

I am still looking for a new name to show that this is an enhanced version of
the original editres. Since I had no better ideas I call it editres2. Suggestions
are welcome.


What are the changes implemented to editres2?
---------------------------------------------
I changed the way the user can navigate through the widget tree of the client
(the client is the program which widget tree is analysed by editres). You can
fold a big widget tree to deal with subtrees. It is possible to search nodes
by several categories.

There are a lot of new action routines to configure editres2 as you like with
the resource file ("Editres"). Most of the functions in the menu bar can be
activated by keypress (= accelerators. When you use the Motif window manager or
other Motif programs sometimes the pulldown menues could not be activated. Must
be a bug in the XawSimpleMenu or any other Xaw widget). The actual configuration
can be find out and changed by looking and editing the actual resource file.
To get the path to the actual resource file there is a small program called
"xrp" (.ftp://avahi.inria.fr/pub/xrp.tar.gz)

I changed the outfit a little bit. The area for the tree is larger than the
original version. Editres2 shows a few more status information, a "scrollable
list" for the recent <n> messages (<n> should be configurable as many other
parameters in a dialog, optional program parameters or resource file) and more
menu buttons. Most of the new menu buttons have still no function. I am not
ready with my programming. Feel free to add new functionality (but please
tell me about).

There are new resources and commandline parameters. I explain the parameters,
the new application resources are similar (i.e. "-numFlashes 4" can be
given as a resource like ".Editres.numFlashes: 4"). Application resources
couldn't be set interactively by 'Resource->Set Resource' or by loading a
new resource file! The commandline parameters are:

-debug			get debug information (not yet supported)
-numFlashes <n>		number of flashes to locate a widget in client
-flashTime <n>		time of each flash im milliseconds
-saveResourceFile <s>	name of file to save created resources by resource box

-winID <n>		window ID of root window from client to connect to
			(editres tries to get the widget tree immediately after
			 startup from this client)
-resFile <s>		resource file to load into the client after getting
			the widget tree from the client
-terminate		terminate editres after loading a new resource file
			into a client

With "-winID" and "-resFile" it is possible to change the language of a
program without changing its internal state! In the future I extract this
functionality to a small programm called "batchres".

Editres2 can print the widget tree to a postscript file.


How to use a XToolkit programs with editres
-------------------------------------------
Editres is a tool for debugging widgets and their resources. Widgets are
introduced with the XToolkit. There are a lot of widget sets based on the
XToolkit, for example the Athena Widget Set (Xaw), OSF/Motif (Xm), OpenLook
and some others (I heard about InterViews (iv) and XView (xv) but don't
know much about them). With editres you can analyse the widget tree of a
client and manipulate its resources online. The client must understand the
editres protocol (introduced with X11R5 in the Misc Utilities libraries, Xmu.
There are some implementations for X11R4). It is not possible to read or set
application resources (loaded by XtGetApplicationResources).

Programs which use the Xaw library have the editres protocol built in. Some
Motif vendors also build editres support to their implementations by adding
the editres protocol th the vendorShellWidgetClass (like SGI and Digital).
LessTif has already editres support built in. If you have a motif program
with motif as a shared library and you point the motif shared library to
the LessTif shared library your program should automatically support the
editres protocol.

If you use a widget set implementation that doesn't support the editres
protocol (like Sun's Motif) and want your program to be able to communicate
with editres just do the following three things:

1. Add "#include <X11/Xmu/Editres.h>"
2. For every shell widget you want to be able to be selected by editres, add
   "XtAddEventHandler(mysh,NoEventMask,True,_XEditResCheckMessages,(XtPointer)NULL);"
  This is only for one shell widget neccessary, if you have more shell widgets
  managed my the window manager (subclass of WMShell) the event handler can
  be added to every shell widget for convenience (only shell with this event
  handler recognizes the selection by editres). Editres always gets the whole
  widget tree if it can establish a communication to a client program.
3. Link your program with the X11 Misc Utilities library (Xmu):
  "gcc myprog.c -o myprog -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11"

The libXmu library is not fully implemented. Normally it is not possible to
get the value of a resource (MB2 in the resource box retrieves a "NoValue").
The file "editres.patch" patches the sources of the misc utilities libraries.
With this patch it should be possible to get the values of the resources from
the client. The file "editres.patch" is from Peter Derr.

editres.patch
	(this is a patch for the library 'libXmu'. The function 'GetValues'
	 for the editres protocol is not fully implemented. So you get the
	 response "NoValue" in editres if you try to read a resource value
	 from the client by mouse button 2 in the resource box. To use
	 this function you have to get the sources for the XMiscUtilities
	 library libXmu from ftp.x.org, patch it an generate your own
	 libXmu.)


How to build editres2
---------------------
It should be easy to generate the executable for editres:
	xmkmf
	make depend
	make
