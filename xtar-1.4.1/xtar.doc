 NAME
      xtar 1.4 - view contents of a tar file

 SYNOPSIS
      xtar [Xoptions] [tarfile[.gz|.Z]]

 DESCRIPTION
      XTar is a Motif program for viewing and manipulating tar archives
      (which may be compressed).  The contents of the archive are displayed
      in the main window and various options are available from pulldown and
      popup menus.

      The main window shows the name of the file currently displayed, its
      size and its size when unpacked.

      The main XTar pulldown menu has the following options:

      OPEN             Open a new tar file.

      UNPACK ALL       Unpack the entire archive.  All files are extracted
                       in the same directory as the tar archive itself.

      UNPACK ALL AS... Unpack the entire archive somewhere else.  This
                       allows you to select another location to extract the
                       tar archive.  You can interactively select a
                       directory from the file selection box or type in the
                       name of a new directory which will be created.

      SEARCH...        Perform a regular expression search on the FILENAMES
                       in the tar file.  This can also be activated by
                       pressing '/' in the main window.

      NEXT             Search for the next occurence of the regular
                       expression.  This can also be activated by pressing

      CONVERT UID/GID  Convert user IDs and group IDs to names on the
                       current system.

      QUIT             Exit XTar.

      The Option pulldown menu allows you to perform actions on the
      currently selected file.  A similar menu is available by pressing the
      right mouse button in the list window.  Furthermore if you set the
      resource "showPB" to True then buttons are displayed at the bottom of
      the main window to perform these actions too.  They are as follows:

      VIEW             View a file.  This uses the XTar resource "mappings"
                       to display the selected file.  If the file ending
                       matches one in the list then the appropriate external
                       viewer is called; otherwise it is assumed to be text
                       and a window is opened.  The text window also shows

                       the currently selected file and its size.

      EXTRACT          If you have selected a file, this extracts that file
                       into the current directory.  If you have selected a
                       directory this unpacks it in the same directory as
                       the the tar file.

      EXTRACT AS...    Allows you to save the file or directory under
                       another name.  If you try and extract a directory
                       into a directory which does not exist, then it is
                       created first.

      The Set Attributes pulldown menu allows you to set permissions,
      ownership, and, if you are root, the group id and time stamp, on
      extracted files.  To enable these options simply toggle the
      corresponding button.

      The Info pulldown menu allows you to access copyright information and
      the xtar man page.
