AB   An implicit monotone relaxation method of second-order of accuracy
     with respect to the space coordinates for calculating steady
     two-dimensional flows of spontaneously condensing and wet steam is
     constructed. Possible applications of the method are demonstrated
     using the examples of the calculation of flows of spontaneously
     condensing vapour in nozzles and turbine cascades. A comparison is
     made with calculation and the experimental results obtained
     elsewhere.

AB   This paper gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness
     of solutions and for the convergence of Picard iterations and more
     general waveform relaxation methods for differential-algebraic
     systems of neutral type. The results are obtained by the contraction
     mapping principle on Banach spaces with weighted norms and by the
     use of the Perron-Frobenius theory of nonnegative and nonreducible
     matrices. It is demonstrated that waveform relaxation methods are
     convergent faster than the classical Picard iterations.

AB   The multigrid waveform relaxation (WR) algorithm has been fairly
     studied and implemented for parabolic equations. It has been found
     that the performance of the multigrid WR method for a parabolic
     equation is practically the same as that of multigrid iteration for
     the associated steady state elliptic equation. However, the
     properties of the multigrid WR method for hyperbolic problems are
     relatively unknown. This paper studies the multigrid acceleration to
     the WR iteration for hyperbolic problems, with a focus on the
     convergence comparison between the multigrid WR iteration and the
     multigrid iteration for the corresponding steady state equations.
     Using a Fourier-Laplace analysis in two case studies, it is found
     that the multigrid performance on hyperbolic problems no longer
     shares the close resemblance in convergence factors between the WR
     iteration for parabolic equations and the iteration for the
     associated steady state equations.

AB   An information theory based multiple alignment ("Malign") method was
     used to align the DNA binding sequences of the OxyR and Fis
     proteins, whose sequence conservation is so spread out that it is
     difficult to identify the sites. In the algorithm described, the
     information content of the sequences is used as a unique global
     criterion for the quality of the alignment. The algorithm uses
     look-up tables to avoid recalculating computationally expensive
     functions such as the logarithm. Because there are no arbitrary
     constants and because the results are reported in absolute units
     (bits), the best alignment can be chosen without ambiguity. Starting
     from randomly selected alignments, a hill-climbing algorithm can
     track through the immense space of sn combinations, where s is the
     number of sequences and n is the number of positions possible for
     each sequence. Instead of producing a single alignment, the
     algorithm is fast enough that one can afford to use many start
     points and to classify the solutions. Good convergence is indicated
     by the presence of a single well-populated solution class having
     higher information content than other classes. The existence of
     several distinct classes for the Fis protein indicates that those
     binding sites have self-similar features.

AB   Probabilistic relaxation labeling processes have been widely used in
     many different fields including image processing, pattern
     recognition, and artificial intelligence. However it is impossible
     to express conviction degrees to be related to human subjectivity.
     We propose a novel relaxation scheme called "robust relaxation" for
     structural matching under uncertainty. Since this method is
     constructed on the Dempster-Shafer measure, the above problem can be
     solved.

AB   Proposes an extension of the epsilon -relaxation method to
     generalized network flow problems with separable convex cost. The
     method maintains epsilon -complementary slackness satisfied at all
     iterations and adjusts the arc flows and the node prices so as to
     satisfy flow conservation upon termination. Each iteration of the
     method involves either a price change at a node or a flow change at
     an arc or a flow change around a simple cycle. Complexity bounds for
     the method are derived. For one implementation employing epsilon
     -scaling, the bound is polynomial in the number of nodes N, the
     number of arcs A, a certain constant Gamma depending on the arc
     gains, and ln( epsilon 0/ epsilon ), where epsilon 0 and epsilon
     denote, respectively, the initial and the final epsilon .

     multisplitting successive overrelaxation methods for solving large

     multiprocessors. These new methods particularly include the
     so-called nonlinear multisplitting SOR-Newton method, the nonlinear

     SOR-Steffensen method. Under suitable conditions, we establish local
     convergence theories of the new methods, and investigate their
     asymptotic convergence rates. Numerical results show that our new
     methods are feasible and efficient for parallel solution of
     nonlinear complementarity problems.

AB   The lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel method is modified for the
     simulation of viscous flows on massively parallel computers. The
     resulting diagonal data-parallel lower-upper relaxation (DP-LUR)
     method is shown to have good convergence properties on many
     problems. However, the convergence rate decreases on the high cell
     aspect ratio grids required to simulate high Reynolds number flows.
     Therefore, the diagonal approximation is relaxed, and a full matrix
     version of the DP-LUR method is derived. The full matrix method
     retains the data-parallel properties of the original and reduces the
     sensitivity of the convergence rate to the aspect ratio of the
     computational grid. Both methods are implemented on the Thinking
     Machines CM-5, and a large fraction of the peak theoretical
     performance of the machine is obtained. The low memory use and high
     parallel efficiency of the methods make them attractive for
     large-scale simulation of viscous flows.

AB   This paper presents a practical method of solving the power system
     unit commitment problem by using a genetic algorithm and the
     Lagrangian relaxation method, making use of the advantages of both.
     Moreover, the introduction of heuristics simplifies genetic string
     manipulations which improve computational efficiency. Numerical
     results have shown that the method is effective in solving the
     practical unit commitment problem.

AB   A conductivity relaxation experiment has been conducted on an
     SrFeCo0.5Ox sample by abruptly changing the oxygen partial pressure
     in the atmosphere and monitoring the change of conductivity as a
     function of time. The re-equilibrium process obeys Fick's second
     law. By fitting the relaxation data to the solution of the diffusion
     equation with appropriate boundary conditions, we could determine
     the oxygen chemical diffusion coefficient and the activation energy.
     The oxygen diffusion coefficient is 8.9*10-7 cm2/s at 900 degrees C
     and it increases with increase in temperature. Measured activation
     energy is 0.92 eV, which is slightly lower than that of other oxides
     in the system SrFe1-xCoxOy.

AB   The fault simulation of analogue circuits is an inherently difficult
     problem because of the lack of a simple fault model and because
     analogue simulation is itself slow. This paper describes a technique
     in which faulty and fault-free circuits are simulated together, such
     that if the terminal voltages of an active device are the same for
     the faulty and fault-free circuit, the model values calculated for
     the fault-free simulation are reused in the faulty simulation. A
     simple example is given in which it is shown that some savings in
     the CPU time are possible. Suggestions for further development of
     the algorithm to give substantial CPU savings are given.

AB   Various rests have been carried out in order to compare the
     performances of several methods used to solve the non-symmetric
     linear systems of equations arising from implicit discretizations of
     CFD problems, namely the scalar advection-diffusion equation and the
     compressible Euler equations. The iterative schemes under
     consideration belong to three families of algorithms: relaxation
     (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel), gradient and Newton methods. Two gradient
     methods have been selected: a Krylov subspace iteration method
     (GMRES) and a non-symmetric extension of the conjugate gradient
     method (CGS). Finally, a quasi-Newton method has also been
     considered (Broyden). The aim of this paper is to provide
     indications of which appears to be the most adequate method
     according to the particular circumstances as well as to discuss the
     implementation aspects of each scheme.

AB   Optimization problems with interval constraints are encountered in
     various fields such as network flows and computer tomography. As
     these problems are usually very large, they are not easy to solve
     without taking their sparsity into account. Recently "row-action
     methods", which originate from the classical Hildreth's method for
     quadratic programming problems, have drawn much attention, since
     they are particularly useful for large and sparse problems. Various
     row-action methods have already been proposed for optimization
     problems with interval constraints, but they mostly belong to the
     class of sequential methods based on the Gauss-Seidel and SOR
     methods. In this paper, we propose a highly parallelizable method
     for solving those problems, which may be regarded as an application
     of the Jacobi method to the dual of the original problems. We prove
     convergence of the algorithm and report some computational results
     to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB   The feasibility of using high temperature stress relaxation to
     monitor the restoration process in hot deformed austenite has been
     studied. The stress relaxation technique was applied to determine
     the kinetics of softening in C-Mn and C-Mn-Nb steels, and the
     effects of temperature, axisymmetric compressive strain, strain
     rate, and reheating temperature are demonstrated and the results
     compared with the predicted values. In particular; the role of
     niobium in preventing recrystallisation is considered. The results
     show that the method is able to reveal the progress of static
     recrystallisation, and that the softening ratio at any given time
     can be predicted from the recorded relaxation curves. The effects of
     some particular experimental factors on the results are discussed,
     such as an applied stress during the softening and the longitudinal
     temperature gradient present in the specimens. The particular
     effectiveness of the technique for the investigation of fast
     restoration processes such as recovery and metadynamic
     recrystallisation due to instantaneous data acquisition after the
     deformation stage is emphasised.

     considers multiple NOx constraints and incorporates the utilization
     of the affected units (those named in the legislation) along with
     SO2 constraints. It also proposes a new algorithm to solve the
     problem for large power systems. This algorithm has the ability to
     handle a large number of various types of linear and nonlinear
     environmental constraints. It is reliable, and viable for both
     offline and online applications. Test results on a large size power
     system demonstrate the possible savings which can be realized by
     using the algorithm. Details of the problem formulation and the
     solution technique are given in the paper.

AB   A number of new NMR methods have been introduced for measuring
     molecular self-diffusion coefficients in the fringe field of
     superconducting magnets, avoiding the determination of longitudinal
     and transverse magnetization relaxation rates. Constant-relaxation
     methods based on the stimulated-echo product signals allow the
     determination of both constant and time-dependent diffusion
     coefficients. A density-operator formalism taking into account
     phenomenologically the effect of relaxation and diffusion encoding
     on the Liouville coordinates has been used to introduce and
     characterize an inhomogeneous mixed echo. This echo corresponds to a
     spatial and temporal superposition of a conventional spin echo and a
     stimulated echo. The mixed echo is generated by the action of a
     pulse sequence based on a stimulated-echo three-pulse sequence with
     an insertion of a Carr-Purcell-like pulse sequence in the last pulse
     interval. A constant relaxation method using a Carr-Purcell
     mixed-echo pulse sequence has been developed. It has proved to be
     advantageous when T2 is not very small compared to T1. The
     performance and limitations of these methods are discussed and
     demonstrated experimentally.

AB   We propose a novel stroke segmentation method and two modified
     relaxation methods with which to recognize handwritten Chinese
     characters. The new stroke segmentation method is based on thinning
     and quadratic equation fit. After stroke segmentation and size
     normalization, redundant strokes are detected and deleted. With the
     deletion of redundant strokes, only prominent strokes that must
     appear in the writing of a character are stored in the database,
     greatly decreasing the matching time and complexity. The features of
     each stroke are then extracted. Using the features of a character,
     two modified relaxation matching methods are introduced to recognize
     the unknown input character. After relaxation matching, certain
     rules are devised to detect certain distorted characters, and also
     to resolve ambiguity when it happens. Some of these distorted
     characters are reconstructed and their feature vector lists are
     modified to reflect the change. It is then sent back to the feedback
     relaxation matching process once again. Experiments are conducted on
     300 constrained handwritten characters written by two people; 13
     similar characters and 42 distorted characters are also tested to
     verify the validity of the approach. The success rate for stroke
     segmentation is 93.3%. Two proposed matching methods are also
     efficient and suitable for stroke-based Chinese character
     recognition. The overall recognition rate is 98.7%, without using
     Rules 2-5 and without considering the abnormal connection and
     intersection of strokes.

     features in the image, satisfactory detection can be obtained in all

     polypeptide with a known amino acid sequence and the 2-D NMR spectra
     (both COSY and NOESY), RUBIDIUM yields plausible assignments of
     lines that account for most signals observed in the spectrum and
     conform to prior chemical knowledge. Rules of pattern matching are
     used to detect plausible signal patterns. The expertise of the
     sequence-specific assignment task is formulated to assign a signal
     pattern to amino acids. To cope with ambiguities and noise, RUBIDIUM
     adopts various low-level data preprocessing techniques, the strategy
     of divide and conquer, and the relaxation technique to decrease the
     complexity and recover from overconstrained conditions. The
     polypeptides oxytocin and vasopressin are used to illustrate the
     performance of RUBIDIUM.

AB   The relaxation method is suitable for analysis of large-scale
     circuits such as those simulating VLSI circuits. Complex frequency
     domain analysis by means of the Laplace transform is carried out.
     Semiconducting elements such as transistors of the VLSI circuits
     exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Thus, the differential equations
     to be used in the relaxation method must be nonlinear. In some
     cases, the properties of nonlinear elements are given not by
     analytic functions but by a series of discrete numerical values such
     as observed data. To express the nonlinearity of these elements,
     multidimensional interpolation formulas are used and practical
     computer algorithms for solving them are derived. The analysis of
     the conditions of convergence of the relaxation method shows that
     the proposed algorithm is applicable to circuits which operate in
     both stable and unstable domains, such as oscillators.

     layer interaction on a flat plate (Minfinity =2.0) and (2) a

     high-speed (i.e., supersonic/hypersonic) viscous flows. The new
     algorithm depends on a partitioning of the global domain into
     regions or sub-domains, where a relatively thin 'elliptic' region is
     identified near each solid wall boundary, and the remainder of the
     flowfield is identified to be a single larger 'hyperbolic' (i.e.,
     hyperbolic/parabolic in the streamwise direction) region. A direct
     solution procedure by lower/upper factorization is applied to the
     elliptic region, the results of which are then coupled to a standard
     line Gauss-Seidel relaxation sweep across the entire domain in the
     primary flow direction.

     based on the assumption that the heat flow through the borehole wall
     is constant in time and only a function of depth during the
     disturbance phase. The new approach described in this paper offers a
     solution to the problem which does not refer directly to the thermal
     history during the disturbance phase. It is only based on
     temperature measurements during the relaxation phase when the
     disturbance fades away by conduction.

     commitment problem composed of three types of generating units. In
     the proposed unit commitment algorithm, the transmission loss is
     expressed as a quadratic function of generator outputs. In the
     demand increasing period in the morning, the planning period (one
     hour) should be divided into shorter periods such as a half an hour
     of fifteen minutes, and the ramping rate constraints should be
     imposed on generator outputs. Since the unit commitment problem
     (primal problem) is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer
     programming problem, the Lagrangian relaxation method is employed to
     solve the problem efficiently.

AB   A marching iterative method for solving the three-dimensional
     incompressible and steady reduced Navier-Stokes equations in general
     orthogonal coordinate systems is described with the velocity and the
     pressure as dependent variables. The coupled set of the linearized
     finite-difference continuity and momentum equations are solved
     iteratively without any splitting or factorization errors. Each
     iteration consists of spatial marching from the upstream boundary to
     the downstream boundary. The discrete continuity and the two
     linearized crossflow momentum equations are satisfied at each
     marching step, even when the mainstream momentum equation is not
     converged. This solution procedure is equivalent to the solution of
     a single Poisson-like equation by the successive plane over
     relaxation method, while other available solution methods employ a
     Jacobi-type iterative scheme and therefore are less efficient.
     Several properties of the numerical method have been assessed
     through a series of tests performed on the laminar incompressible
     flow over prolate spheroids at intermediate incidence.

AB   Viscous and lamina flow simulations are a source of problems at very
     high Reynolds number (Re) because of the boundary layers. Extremely
     thin discretization grids are needed in the perpendicular direction
     to the boundary layer and that produces a bad, or at least mediocre,
     conditioning of the linear systems. The author does not propose a
     new approximation in order to solve the problem, but a new way of
     resolving the linear system that arises from a finite element
     discretization of the nonstationary, incompressible and laminar
     Navier-Stokes equations. It is a simple idea that consists in
     changing the method of resolution in the boundary layer by a block
     relaxation method, adapted to physics, that imitates the method of
     resolution of the parabolic Prandtl boundary layer equations, while
     in the remaining domain a Cholesky or conjugate gradient method is
     employed. The global linear system is solved by blocks. The first
     corresponds to the boundary layer and wake; the second corresponds
     to the remaining domain. The author obtained better results on a
     wing profile at Reynolds number 100000 because this method seems not
     to propagate the round off errors due to the bad conditioning of the
     global linear system.

     approach using the augmented Lagrangian method. Two Lagrangian
     relaxations are studied. In the first one, the time constraints are
     relaxed producing network subproblems which are easy to solve, but
     the bound obtained is weak. In the second relaxation, constraints
     requiring that each node be visited are relaxed producing shortest
     path subproblems with time window constraints and integrality
     conditions. The bound produced is always excellent. Numerical
     results for several actual school busing problems with up to 223
     nodes are discussed. Comparisons with a set partitioning formulation
     solved by column generation are given.

AB   The waveform relaxation method is a repetitive method of the
     initialization problem for the algebraic/differential equation
     system, which is similar to Picard's consecutive simulation, the
     method to apply the Newton method to differential equations, etc.
     The waveform relaxation method has lately been proved to be
     effective particularly for simulation of the MOS digital circuit.
     The multirate integration method is effective for transient analysis
     of the circuit. In the waveform relaxation method, multirate
     integration is carried in a natural form. The author describes the
     convergence of the waveform relaxation method in transient analysis
     of the MOS digital circuit and high-speed simulation techniques.

AB   Investigations on the use of an exponential relaxation technique for
     studying corrosion systems are reported. The polarisation resistance
     and the double layer capacitance of corrosion systems can be
     obtained by the small amplitude exponential relaxation technique
     (SAERT). The rate of corrosion can be measured by the large
     amplitude exponential relaxation technique (LAERT). This technique
     yields an 'accelerated Tafel plot' only when the charging current is
     negligible, which is seldom so. Methods for correcting for double
     layer charging are described. Double layer capacitance as a function
     of potential is obtained from LAERT. Therefore it can be used for
     studies on inhibitors. The utility of LAERT for corrosion systems
     with only one of the conjugate reactions under activation control is
     established. The effect of series resistance (Re) is discussed and
     an in situ method for its determination is described. A procedure
     for correcting the experimental data for errors due to Re is given.

AB   An iterative method is developed for the solution of the steady
     Euler equations for inviscid flow. The system of hyperbolic
     conservation laws is discretized by a finite-volume
     Osher-discretization. The iterative method is a multiple grid (FAS)
     iteration with symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) as a relaxation method.
     Initial estimates are obtained by full multigrid (FMG). In the
     pointwise relaxation the equations are kept in block-coupled form
     and local linearization of the equations and the boundary conditions
     is considered. The efficient formulation of Osher's discretization
     of the 2-D nonisentropic steady Euler equations and its
     linearization is presented. The efficiency of FAS-SGS iteration is
     shown for a transonic model problem. It appears that, for the
     problem considered, the rate of convergence is almost independent of
     the grid size and that for all mesh sizes the discrete system is
     solved up to truncation error accuracy in only a few (2 or 3)
     iteration cycles.

AB   Using the example of Cauchy-Riemann equations, the flux-vector
     splitting method is illustrated for systems of first order
     equations. It is shown that for this linear elliptic system of
     equations, flux-vector splitting combined with upwind differencing
     results in discrete equations which can be solved by relaxation
     methods. It is shown how the same splitting can be used on the
     hybrid first order (subprincipal) part of the steady Navier-Stokes
     equations in primitive variable form. By the use of central
     difference discretisations on the second order (principal) part, the
     resulting set of discrete equations can be solved by relaxation
     methods. A computational example on a backward facing step problem
     is given.

     depth of search in the ordered-generation-of-assignments framework.
     The algorithm is supported by a numerical example and its advantages

AB   A non-stationary method for measuring thermal conductivity and
     thermal diffusivity of small plane-parallel samples (5*5*1 mm3) is
     developed. The principle of the method consists in measuring the
     time dependence of the temperature of a plane heat source heated by
     a constant power during a finite time interval. The heat capacity of
     the source is taken into account in the formulation of the problem.
     A model is proposed to estimate a parasitical heat flow through the
     lead-in wires of the heat source and the wires of the thermocouple
     used for measuring the temperature of the heat source. The method is
     suitable for a quick measuring of the temperature dependence of
     thermal parameters.

AB   In spite of the large variety of existing transport processes they
     all have one fundamental property in common: these processes strive
     to neutralize external actions that take a system out of the
     equilibrium state. Any physical system has some inertia, related to
     internal processes specific to the system. Such processes are
     activated with breakdown of equilibrium and are characterized by
     their own internal variables. The approach of the system to
     equilibrium, which results in the observed transport processes, can
     be viewed as a collection of relaxation processes for these internal
     variables. The authors limit their analysis to the relaxation
     formalism of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and they briefly analyze
     its relation to the methods of the theory of dynamic systems.

AB   Many hard integer programming problems can be viewed as easy
     problems complicated by a relatively small set of side constraints.
     Dualizing the side constraints produces a Lagrangian problem that is
     easy to solve and whose optimal value is a lower bound (for
     minimization problems) on the optimal of the original problem. The
     Lagrangian problem can thus be used in place of a linear programming
     relaxation to provide bounds in a branch and bound algorithm. This
     approach has led to dramatically improved algorithms for a number of
     important problems in the areas of routing, location, scheduling,
     assignment and set covering. The paper is a review of Lagrangian
     relaxation based on what has been learned in the last decade.

AB   Probabilistic relaxation estimates the probabilities of the
     potential labelings of the nodes of a multigraph. The constraints
     used are limited to those nodes which are connected by arcs in this
     multigraph. A multiplicative formula called the product rule is
     introduced for combining the estimates of several nodes. This
     formula is then shown to correspond to a discrete relaxation
     operator. Experiments were made using the product rule to break a
     substitution cipher and to disambiguate the semantic labeling of the
     pixels of a color image of a house. The experiments showed that in
     some applications, the product rule converges more rapidly to
     estimates that permit making reasonable decisions than did a
     previous formula using arithmetic averaging. The experiments also
     suggested ways to refine the relaxation formulas to produce more
     precise estimates.

AB   The approximate discrete solution of the fundamental steady state
     conservation equations of classical physics and in particular fluid
     mechanics leads in general to large nonlinear systems of algebraic
     equations, which must be solved iteratively. Of predominant interest
     is, of course, the reliability of the discrete analogue of the basic
     conservation laws (numerical model) for finite mesh size. Due to the
     inherent limitations of available computers (speed, capacity) a
     second issue plays an equally important role namely the problem of
     efficiency of iterative methods. The acceleration of the convergence
     of these methods to solve stationary partial differential equations
     is the subject of relaxation.

     it was constructed. An iterative solution of a coupled set of

     carry successive approximates to a state that is invariant with
     further iteration and independent of the initial guess. This defines
     a process of relaxation. The time-like aspect and basic principles

AB   An algorithm is presented for estimating the density distribution in
     a cross section of an object from X-ray data which in practice is
     unavoidably noisy. The data give rise to a large sparse system of
     inconsistent equations, not untypically 105 equations with 104
     unknowns, with only about 1% of the coefficients non-zero. Using the
     physical interpretation of the equations, each equality can in
     principle be replaced by a pair of inequalities, giving the limits
     within which the sum is believed to lie. An algorithm is proposed
     for solving this set of inequalities. The algorithm is basically a
     relaxation method. A finite convergence result is proved. In spite
     of the large size of the system, in the application area of interest
     practical solution on a computer is possible because of the simple
     geometry of the problem and the redundancy of equations obtained
     from nearby X-rays. The algorithm has been implemented, and is
     demonstrated by actual reconstructions.

     processes contributing to the absorption and emission coefficients
     are considered in microscopic detail. The local electron temperature
     is obtained by solving the kinetic-energy balance equation for the
     electron gas. All electron collisional and radiative processes
     whereby kinetic energy is gained and lost by the electron gas are
     considered. Thomson scattering is taken into account in formulating
     the equation of radiative transfer. The free-bound and bound-bound
     radiation is transferred throughout the atmosphere by use of the
