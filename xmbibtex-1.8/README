......   Description   ......
-----------------------------

xmbibtex is a Motif (LessTif) reference manager based on the BibTeX
file format. It allows to add, delete, and edit references. The
references can be saved in the BibTeX file format and also written on
a LaTeX file that can be printed using LaTeX and BibTeX. References
can be retrieved by several search strategies. Import of references
from the Medline and Inspec file format is included. However, I found
that the Medline file format is not unique. Up to now, there are
import filters available for the "Ovid Medline", the "PubMed Medline"
and for the "Spirs Medline" format. It would be nice if some people
could write additional import filters for other file formats.

If you find this program useful, I would appreciate receiving a
picture postcard from your home city (although this is not enforced
since the program is GPL).
