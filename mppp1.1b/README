Requirement
===========
    1) ANSI C compiler if you want to compile.
    2) At least Motif 1.1a if you wanto to compile the Moitf version. 

ppp and xmppp are two configurable ppp dialers.   mppp is a character 
based ppp dialer and xmppp is written in X/Motif.   Either one can be used
to make ppp connection. 

The programs talks to the modem device directly, therefore, no external 
scripts are needed.

I wrote and tested them on Redhat Linux 4.1. But they should be portable 
to other Unices with POSIX termios. I wrote it because none of the ppp 
dialers worked the way I wanted. I wanted the configuration files must be 
editable by a text editor. It works the way I like. I'm releasing it with 
the hope that it might be useful to you.

NOTE:   Not enough error checking at this time. So you better have correct
        configuration and script file in order to make it work preperly.

To Do
=====
    * better documentation.
    * rigorous error checking.
    * editing configuration and script file from xmppp's edit menu.
    * allow entering password interactively.
    * ..and many more.

How you can help
===============
I do not have much time to play. So if you find a bug, best thing would be
to fix it and send me the patch. If you some cool idea, implement it and
send me the patch.  In any event, let me know.


Compile
=======
    edit Makefile.no-motif and Xmppp.tmpl. Tunrn on DEBUG option if you want.

    Compiling mppp (character based)
    ================================
        $ make clean
        $ make -f Makefile.no-motif
    The name of the binary is mppp.


    Compiling xmppp (X/Motif)
    =========================
        $ xmkmf
        $ make clean
        $ make
    The name of the binary is xmppp.

Install
=======
    NOTE:
    Currently two files are necessary. The name of these files are
    mppp.cfg and fccc.scr. They must be located at user's $HOME/.mpppdir
    directory. However this will change in future.

    mkdir $HOME/.mpppdir
        [if you run ppp as root, it will be at root's home, not yours]

    cp ./dotmpppdir/* $HOME/.mpppdir
    cd $HOME/.mpppdir

    * edit  mppp.cfg file. 
        change  
            MpppLogfile
            Device
            InitString
            Script

    * edit fccc.scr or the name you provided with Script above.
        - replace <Your login> with your login name
        - replabe <Your password> with your password.

Enjoy!
