=======================================

This is release 1.2 of xplore, a powerful and highly configurable Motif file
manager with an Explorer-like user interface. Please refer to the
documentation in the etc subdirectory for more information.

Xplore owes much to xfm, the popular (albeit a bit dated ;-) X file manager
written by Simon Marlow and myself, and moxfm, a very nice Motif port of xfm
with many additional features, which has been developed by Oliver Mai.
However, drawing from the experiences with xfm, I redesigned and reimplemented
this one from scratch, and in fact xplore incorporates only very little of the
original xfm/moxfm source code.

You'll need the Xpm library and Motif 2.x for compiling this program. Please
refer to the file INSTALL for detailed installation instructions. Precompiled
binaries in a variety of formats are available from xplore's homepage at

	http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/~ag/xplore

which also provides the latest information and sources. (At the time of this
writing, only Linux and Solaris x86 binaries are available, as these currently
are the only system with Motif 2.x I have access to. If you can contribute
binaries for other systems, please let me know.)

I have used various versions of this program under Linux 2.0.18-2.4.18 with
XFree 3.x/4.x and different Motif 2.x versions for several years now, and so I
believe that the latest release (which has been tested on SuSE Linux 8 and
Solaris 8) is fairly stable and bug-free. The remaining major issue is
probably portability, since xplore _really_ requires Motif 2.x. I am hoping on
LessTif here, which already supports quite a few platforms, but when I last
checked it still lacked some of the Motif 2.x widgets required by xplore.

As always, I would like to thank the many brave xplore testers out there on
the net for their bug reports and other inputs which helped a lot to improve
the current version. Please send me any bug fixes and other patches necessary
for porting xplore to other platforms, so that I can incorporate them in
future releases. Questions, suggestions, bug reports and all other kinds of
contributions are also welcome.

Enjoy!
