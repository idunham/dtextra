Xplore Color Schemes
------ ----- -------

The files in this subdirectory contain different color resource sets, mostly
pilfered from some of the KDE color schemes. A scheme for the GNOME fans is
also included, as well as some other home-made stuff. ;-) 

The *.scheme files can be used to set a color scheme with the "Color scheme"
option in the "Options" menu. The Xplore.ad file is a generic scheme which can
be used with KDE2. If you copy this file to the appropriate directory
(<kde-prefix>/share/apps/kdisplay/app-defaults), then xplore will adapt to
the color scheme selected within the KDE control panel.
