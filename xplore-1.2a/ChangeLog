1.2a: maintenance release [Aug 16 2002]

	New features:

	- add experimental support for text/uri-list targets (export only)

	This enables you to drag files from xplore to KDE and GNOME
	applications and desktop (but not vice versa). A recent KDE/GNOME
	version with Motif DND support is required to make this work.
	
	Bug fixes:

	- fixed some minor bugs related to the new Locate command

	As a bonus, I also added some new application icons pilfered from
	KDE and GNOME. Enjoy! :)
	
1.2: third major release [Aug 13 2002]

	New features:

	- new log popup menu features the "Locate" command which allows
	you to quickly locate a file or directory listed in the log pane
	(useful, e.g., with the "Find" command)

	Cosmetic changes:

	- the "Bindings" dialog has been renamed to "File type"

	- the "Comment" field in file type definitions is now called
	"Description" (for backward compatibility, the "Comment" keyword
	in config files is still supported)

	- the log pane now uses a fixed width font

	- updated system.xplorerc and magic files

	Bug fixes:

	- prevent unwanted error output of `which' in the setup, install
	and netscape-remote scripts

	- device indicators are now updated correctly when unmounted
	devices are mounted by another program

	- MIME types are now determined correctly for files which have the
	executable bit set (make sure you replace your .xplore/magic file
	with the latest copy to make this work)
	
1.1e: maintenance release [Sep 11 2001]

	- parse.c and lex.c are now included in the source package; this
	fixes a problem with broken flex scanners on some systems

	- reworked Modern and SolarisCDE color schemes

	- updated the installation instructions

	- fixed missing xplore library scripts in binary packages
	
1.1d: maintenance release [Sep 08 2001]

	- reorganized bundled xg sources, added an Imakefile
	
	- bug fixes in the drag and drop code and the xplorerc file

	- Solaris/CDE compatibility fixes (tested on Solaris 8/x86)

	- attempt to merge Matt Behrens' OpenBSD patches (untested)
	
1.1c: maintenance release [Aug 30 2001]

	(Summary of changes in the 1.1a, b and c releases.) Most notably,
	the Color scheme option now updates the application immediately,
	and is also recorded per session. The new Clear button in the
	Color scheme dialog lets you revert to the default color settings.

	Other changes:

	- bug fixes in the startup procedure

	- fixed lost output when application is exited during startup

	- fixed some minor glitches in the Color scheme command

	- some cosmetic changes in the system.xplorerc file

	- added a nicer clip_file icon

	- updated manpage and FAQ
	
1.1: second official major release [Aug 26 2001]

	The most important new features are the "log" pane for capturing
	output from child processes (so no need to mess around with
	console windows any more), and full support for the X11R6 session
	management protocol, which makes xplore a well-behaved client of
	modern desktop environments like KDE and GNOME.

	The file type configuration now uses standard MIME type names. To
	enjoy this, you will have to update your personal config files.
	This is recommended anyhow because the standard setup has been
	slightly improved and a bug fix in the magic type code might break
	older setups.

	Other changes:
	
	- splash screen is now disabled by default

	- generally improved user setup and startup procedure

	- device config - skip devices with missing mount points

	- wheel mouse support - requires Z axis mapping to buttons 4 & 5

	- standard setup now checks the XPLORE_EDITOR and XPLORE_TERM
	environment variables to determine your preferred editor and
	terminal program
	
	- netscape-remote script now checks for the browser program,
	looking for either netscape or mozilla; you can also override the
	default choice with the NETSCAPE environment variable

	- help menu now provides various items including the online HTML
	manual (requires netscape)

	- color resource file can now be selected with the "Color scheme"
	command in the Options menu

	- updated color schemes to correct strange colors with newer XFree
	versions

	- added some icons

	- bug fixes
	
1.0d: more bug fixes and some (important) cosmetic changes [Jan 2001]

	I expect this to become release 1.1 after some more thorough
	testing. User-visible changes:

	- xplore's startup directory must now be specified with the -p
	option
	
	- file operations now allow you to browse for the target with the
	file selection dialog
	
	- the file type dialog now allows you to insert a new type before
	*any* type, including the predefined ones

	- dragging a file to a second xplore window now causes the source
	window to be updated as well

	- improved session management - yep, it's finally possible to have
	your window manager automagically save the state of several
	different xplore windows!
	
	- improved system.xplorerc featuring a simpler find command, an
	improved netscape interface, proper treatment of filenames
	containing whitespace, and more

	- more color schemes (including a generic resource file for KDE2),
	and some cosmetic changes in the app-defaults file

	- xplore's hard-coded default icons (file.xpm, folder.xpm, etc.) 
	can now be overridden by replacing the corresponding installed
	icon files (no need to recompile xplore any more)
	
	- the setup script no longer copies the xplorerc and magic files,
	which makes it easier to upgrade the standard config

	- all private configuration files are now kept in a separate user
	configuration directory (~/.xplore by default); the name of the
	private config dir can be set both with resources and from the
	command line, which makes it possible to manage several different
	user setups with ease

	NOTE: if you want to reuse your pre-1.0d .magic, .xplorerc and
	.xploredef files with the new version, rename them to magic,
	xplorerc and defaults, respectively, and move them to the
	~/.xplore directory.

1.0c: yet another step on the road to 1.1 ...

	- support for KDE, GNOME and some other modern apps in
	system.xplorerc (uncomment the corresponding #define's at the
	beginning of the file)
	
	- some more tweaking of resources and magic/xplorerc files, and
	some new addon stuff in the etc subdir

	- finally decided that the "banner" should actually be called a
	"splash screen"; accordingly, I renamed the banner resource and
	the -b option to splash/-nosplash

	- new -help, -version and -C ("redirect output to console")
	command line options

	- improved automounter (delay mounting until a device is
	explicitly opened in the file pane, unless it's already
	premounted)

	- disabled views are now destroyed instead of merely being
	unmanaged, and thus do not require any updates until they are
	shown again
	
	- lots of small bug fixes and optimizations
	
1.0b: another maintenance release

	- fixed some compilation probs on recent Linux systems

	- added xg library sources to make the package self-contained

	- fixed some of the resources for use with Motif 2.1

1.0a: maintenance release

	Some more bug fixes and improvements. User-visible changes:
	
	- make current directory visible in the tree pane when it changes
	(interface.[hc], callbacks.c)

	- add margins to indicators in devices panel (Xplore.cpp)

	- fixed some of the icons

	- added an option to the Command menu which allows you to invoke a
	secondary instance of xplore in the current directory
	(system.xplorerc)

	- added an "Add before" field to the Bindings dialog which lets
	you specify the priority of user-defined types

	- improved error handling in Bindings dialog (check whether the
	edited type matches the file on which the dialog was invoked)

	- updated manpage
	
1.0: first official release [Nov 1997]

	*** Fixes:
	
	- small changes in the distributed standard setup (setup script,
 	system.xplorerc) -- supposed to make things easier for the average
 	user

	- added Juan D. Martin's patches to magic.c (fixes some bugs on
 	systems with 64 bit long integers)

	- fixed an annoying bug in the Save defaults commands
	(callbacks.c) which occurred on systems where the home and tmp
 	directories are on different file systems

	- most problems with keyboard traversal have been fixed; while
 	still not being perfect, it's quite useable now -- see the manpage
 	for details

	- unmounted directories are now automatically remounted when they
	are reopened

	- the minimum size of the main window is now set automatically at
	startup and whenever hiding or showing a pane, using the
	paneMinimum settings of the panes
	
	- a lot of other tiny bug fixes (didn't keep a log, there were so
	many ;-))

	*** Enhancements:

	- the menu structure has been overhauled (see the manpage for
 	details), and all menus can now be torn off

	- the selection policies for the different panes can now be
	configured in the application defaults file

	- copy and delete operations can now be interrupted with Ctrl-C
	
	- added set uid/guid and sticky bits to Properties dialog

	- new "Bindings" dialog to define new and edit existing file types
 	on the fly
	
	- new small icons view; note that the possible view type values
 	now are called "LargeIcons", "SmallIcons" and "Detail"

	- brief file info in the status line if a single file is selected

	- give feedback in status line when updating the view or when a
 	new directory is read
	
	- shell resource to determine the shell that xplore uses to invoke
 	commands

	- added an autosave option to automatically save defaults when
 	exiting
	
	- default settings are now stored in xplore's own resource file
	(~/.xploredef by default) which is read automatically at startup

	- added a setup dialog which prompts the user for confirmation
	before running the setup script

	- added an incremental filename search facility
	
	- added a banner window which pops up when xplore starts (this can
 	be disabled by setting the new banner resource to False). In case
 	you're wondering, the banner has been created with "The GIMP". Great
 	program! ;-)

	- added command line options for suppressing the banner window
	(-b) and for selecting the panes to be shown at startup (-file,
	-tree, -shelf)

	- added some more application icons
	
0.99h: first public beta release [Aug 1997]
