DESCRIPTION:

     Ad2c is a program which converts X resource files into C
     declarations appropriate for inclusion as fallback resources.
     The program is a sed script which is effectively a finite state
     machine, escaping quotes and backslashes (and newlines where
     necessary), and adding quotes and commas as needed for array
     initialization.

DISCLAIMER:

     This software is provided as is with no warranty expressed or implied.
     I hope you find it useful, but I won't be held responsable for
     any damage that may occur from reading, compiling, installing or
     using it.

     You are free to use any part of this code for other purposes. It
     would be nice if you could keep my name on some part of whatever the
     final product is.

INSTALLATION:

     1. Edit the Imakefile to change the installation directories if
	desired.

     2. Execute "xmkmf" to make the Makefile.

     3. Execute "make install" to install ad2c, and/or "make install.man"
	to install the man page. Making ad2c itself is unnecessary.
