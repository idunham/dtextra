<toc>
<![ %fmttex; [ <lof> ]]>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Introduction<p>
&mgv; is a Motif based viewer for &ps; files which uses Ghostscript as the
underlying &ps; rendering engine.  Limitted PDF support is also supplied.

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>Running mgv<p>
Executing &mgv; is very simple:
<verb>
	mgv [switches] [file.ps [...]]
</verb>
If you mention multiple files on the command line, &mgv; will attempt to
open each file in its own window so be careful with
&dquot;<tt>mgv *.ps</tt>&dquot;.
If no initial file is specified, &mgv; will try and read from the standard
input if it looks like there is something there; see the
<ref name="Reading From The Standard Input" id="stdin"> section for details.
The available switches are detailed in the <ref name="Command Line Switches"
id="switches"> section.
You can also use the <em/-help/ switch for a compact list of available
switches or the <em/-longhelp/ switch for a more verbose list.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Main Window<p>
<figure>
	<eps file="mainwindow">
	<img src="mainwindow.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>Main Window</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>The main &mgv; window consists of a menu bar, a tool bar, a page selection
list, a status line, and the main viewing area.  Everything in the main
window except the viewing area can be shown or hidden via the
<ref id=view-menu name="View"> menu.

The menu bar is across the top of the &mgv; window; nothing exciting here.
Note that if the menu bar is hidden, you can still activate it using any
of the standard keyboard short cuts (such as <bf/F10/); the visual effect
may be a little strange but this functionality is quite useful.

The scrolled list along the left side contains the page numbers (if any)
for the current document, selecting an entry in this list will display
the selected page.
Marked pages will appear in a different font as specified in the
<bf/fontList/ resource for the list; the <bf/fontList/ for the list
should contain two fonts named <bf/MARKED/ for marked pages and
<bf/UNMARKED/ for unmarked pages.
Shift-button1 will toggle the marked status of a page in the page list (see
<ref id="marking-pages" name="The Mark Menu"> for more information
on marking pages).
If the <tt/&percnt;&percnt;Page/ comments in the current document
contain page labels, then the page list can display the labels
along with the raw page numbers; you can toggle between page numbers
and labels and just page numbers using the <ref name="Page" id="menu-page">
menu.

Along the bottom of the &mgv; window there is a status line which
displays the name of the current document, the creation date (if
available), and the current cursor position.
If the document contains a <tt/&percnt;&percnt;Title/ comment,
then that will be used as the name, otherwise, the name of the file
is used.
The status line also contains a <ref id="magstep-set" name="magstep">
display and a button for changing the magstep.  When you press this
button, the button will turn into a text field; type in your desired
magstep and press <bf/Enter/ to activate it.  This button has the same
effect as using the <ref id="magstep-set" name="Set..."> entry on
the <em/Magstep/ menu.

The rest of the &mgv; window is the actual viewing area.
Mouse button one will activate the zooming reticule when you are in
this area (see <ref id="zooming" name="Zooming">) and mouse button
two will activate panning.

Inside the viewing area and page list, the cursor keys will scroll the main
window.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The File Menu<p>
The File menu contains the following items:
<descrip>
<tag>Open (Ctrl+O)<label id="file-open"></tag>
	<figure>
		<eps file="file-open">
		<img src="file-open.gif">
		<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>File Open Dialog</caption> ]]>
	</figure>
	<p>This button will open a new file.
	A file selector will be popped up for you to chose a file to open.
	The file selector will have an extra <em/Browse/ toggle button; when
	this toggle is activated, the file selector will not automatically
	pop down when a file has been selected.
	If the <em/New Window/ toggle is on when you select a file, a new
	&mgv; window will be created with your chosen file; otherwise,
	the new file replaces the current file.
	When you open a file, all of the zoom windows attached to the old
	file will be removed from the screen.
	If the selected file appears to compressed (i.e. has an extension
	of <bf/Z/, <bf/z/, <bf/gz/, or <bf/bz2/ and starts with one of the
	correct magic numbers), &mgv; will attempt to decompress it using the
	command specified in the <ref name="gunzip" id="appres-gunzip">,
	<ref name="bunzip" id="appres-bunzip">, or <ref name="decompress"
	id="appres-decompress"> resources.
<p><tag>Reopen (Ctrl+R)<label id="file-reopen"></tag>
	This button re-opens the current file.  The current page number
	will be retained if possible.  If you have explicitly requested
	a page orientation (i.e. you pushed one of the radio buttons in
	the <ref name="Orientation" id="orientation-menu"> menu)
	then that orientation will remain in effect.
	This is equivalent to choosing the current file through
	the <em/Open/ menu entry, reselecting the current page, and
	possibly resetting the orientation.

	You cannot re-open files that came from the standard input.
<p><tag>Save (Ctrl+S)<label id="file-save"></tag>
	<figure>
		<eps file="file-save">
		<img src="file-save.gif">
		<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>File Save Dialog</caption> ]]>
	</figure>
	<p>Activating this entry will prompt you for a file name and write
	the current document, all or only the marked pages, to disk.
	The file selector will have two extra toggle buttons:
	if the <em/Save Marked Pages Only/ toggle is set, only the
	currently marked pages will be written; otherwise, the entire
	document will be written; if the <em/Unmark Pages After Saving/
	toggle is set, all pages will be unmarked after saving.

	If you select a file that already exists, you will be asked if you
	want to overwrite it (the confirmation dialog is modeless so you
	can type in a different name without responding to the confirmation
	request and the <em/right thing/ will be done).

	If the specified file name ends with <em/.Z/ then it will be
	compressed, if it ends with <em/.gz/ then it will be gzipped, if
	it ends with <em/.bz2/ then it will be bzip2ed; the
	<ref name="compress" id="appres-compress">, <ref name="gzip"
	id="appres-gzip">, and <ref name="bzip" id="appres-bzip"> resources
	are used to determine what command should be used for compression.
	The <em/File Save/ dialog can be made <ref name="sticky"
	id="sticky-dialogs">.
<p><tag>Print (Ctrl+P)<label id="file-print"></tag>
	This will bring up a dialog box which allows you to print
	the whole file or just the marked pages (if any); the print
	dialog is explained in <ref id="printing" name="Printing">.
<p><tag>Info (Ctrl+I)<label id="file-info"></tag>
	This will bring up the <ref name="Document Information" id="doc-info">
	dialog.
<p><tag>Close (Ctrl+D)<label id="file-close"></tag>
	Close the current window; if there is only one viewing window,
	then this is equivalent to <em/Exit/.
<p><tag>Exit (Ctrl+C)<label id="file-exit"></tag>
	Exit &mgv;.  If you have more than one viewing window and the
	<bf/confirmExit/ resource is <bf/True/, you will be asked
	for confirmation.
	Note that all of &mgv;'s child processes--including HTML
	browsers--will be terminated (via <bf/SIGTERM/) when &mgv;
	exits (if you don't like this, the <ref name="killChildrenAtExit"
	id="appres-killChildrenAtExit"> resource can be used stop it).
</descrip>

<sect1>The Document Information Dialog<label id="doc-info"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="file-info">
	<img src="file-info.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>The Document Information Dialog</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>The <em/Document Information/ dialog contains the following information
about the document:
<itemize>
<item><bf/Document Title:/
	The document title as specified in the
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;&percnt;Title/&dquot; comment.
<item><bf/Creation Date:/
	The document's creation date as specified in the
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;&percnt;CreationDate/&dquot comment.
<item><bf/For:/
	The person who created the document as specified in the
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;&percnt;For/&dquot comment.  This value
	is normally used by print spoolers to generate a banner page.
<item><bf/Document Creator:/
	The document's creator as specified in the
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;&percnt;Creator/&dquot comment.
	This value will normally be the name of the program that
	created the document.
<item><bf/Default Media:/
	The default page media for the document.  Individual pages
	can have a different media than the rest of the document
	but this appears to be rare.
<item><bf/Number Of Pages:/
	The number of pages in the document.
<item><bf/Document Type:/
	The document type.  This value will be &dquot;PostScript&dquot;
	or &dquot;Encapsulated PostScript&dquot;.
</itemize>
Some of the information will not be available with some documents.
If the document is not DSC compliant, then none of the information will
be available.

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Page Menu<label id="menu-page"><p>
The Page menu contains various page movement controls.
<descrip>
<tag/Next (PageDown), Previous (PageUp)<label id="page-nextprev">/
	Display the next or previous page.
<p><tag/Center (Alt+C)<label id="page-center">/
	Enable or disable page centering.
<p><tag/Redisplay (Alt+R)<label id="page-redisplay">/
	Redisplay the current page.
<p><tag/Show Page Labels (Alt+B), Show Page Numbers (Alt+N)<label id="show-labelsnums">/
	These toggles control what is displayed in the page list.  The
	<em/Page Numbers/ are just absolute position numbers; the
	<em/Page Labels/ are arbitrary strings which were assigned by the
	application which generated the &ps; file.  The labels will often
	match up with the table of contents (if there is one) of the document.
	For example, the page numbers may be <em/1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/ but
	the labels might be <em/0, i, 1, 2, 3, 4/.

	Page labels will appear in parentheses.

	Turning off both page labels and page numbers will remove the
	page list from the screen; if you bring the page list back using
	the <ref name="View" id="view-menu"> menu and both labels and
	numbers are deactivated, the page numbers will be turned on to make
	sure there is something to show.
<p><tag/Automatic Sizing<label id="page-autosize">/
	This sub-menu offers the following radio buttons for controlling
	automatic window sizing:
	<p><descrip>
	<tag/Size (Ctrl+E)/
		Try and keep the main window large enough to display the
		entire page.
	<p><tag/Height (Ctrl+H)/
		Try and keep the main window tall enough to display an
		entire page height.
	<p><tag/Width (Ctrl+W)/
		Try and keep the main window wide enough to display an
		entire page.
	<p><tag/None (Ctrl+N)/
		Leave the window size alone.
	</descrip>

	If your window manager doesn't limit the size of windows (some won't
	let you resize a window to exceed the screen size), then you can
	try and use the <ref name="smartSizing" id="appres-smartSizing">
	resource to limit the resizing.

	Whether or not any of this sizing stuff works is really up to
	your window manager (which is not required to honor out humble
	requests) but most window managers will grant our wishes (within
	limits).
</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The View Menu<label id="view-menu"><p>
The <em/View/ menu supplies buttons for hiding/showing various parts
of the &mgv; user interface; for convenience, the entries in the window
menu are duplicated in the <ref name="popup" id="popup-menu"> menu.
The following items are available:
<descrip>
<tag>Hide Log (Ctrl+L)<label id="view-hidelog"></tag>
	This hides or shows the Ghostscript <ref name="message log"
	id="gs-log">.
<p><tag>Hide Page List (Ctrl+G)<label id="view-hidelist"></tag>
	This hides or shows the page list.  If you have deactivated both
	page labels and page numbers from the <ref name="Page" id="menu-page">
	menu, un-hiding the page list will turn on page numbers so it has
	something to display.
<p><tag>Hide Status Line (Ctrl+T)<label id="view-hidestatus"></tag>
	This hides or shows the status line.
<p><tag>Hide Menu Bar (Ctrl+B)<label id="view-hidemenu"></tag>
	This hides or shows the menu bar.  Note that the menu bar
	and the accelerator keys are still active even when the menu
	bar is hidden--hiding the menu bar only places it underneath
	the main viewing window (this is sneaky but it works just fine).
<p><tag>Hide Tool Bar (Alt+T)<label id="view-hidetoolbar"></tag>
	Hide or show the tool bar.
<p><tag>Close All Zooms (Ctrl+Z)<label id="view-closezoom"></tag>
	This will close all of the existing zoom windows.
</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Mark Menu<label id="marking-pages"><p>
This Mark menu contains the various page marking commands.
<descrip>
<tag>Mark/Unmark(Ctrl+M)<label id="mark-mark"></tag>
	Toggle the marked state of the current page.  If the current page
	is marked, it will become unmarked; if the current page is unmarked,
	it will be marked.
	Marked pages will appear in a different font in the page list.
<p><tag/Mark All (Alt+M), Unmark All (Alt+U)<label id="mark-all">/
	Mark or unmark all of the pages.
<p><tag/Mark Even Pages (Alt+E), Mark Odd Pages (Alt+D)<label id="mark-evenodd">/
	Mark the even/odd numbered pages.
<p><tag/Invert Marked Pages (Alt+I)<label id="mark-invert">/
	Mark the un-marked pages and un-mark the marked pages (i.e. toggle
	the marked status of each page).
</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Magstep Menu<label id="menu-magstep"><p>
The Magstep menu controls the document magnification.  The default magstep,
zero, implies no magnification (i.e. the on-screen image should be the same
size as the paper version).
Positive magsteps increase the magnification by a factor of 1.2 at each step
and negative magsteps decrease the magnification by a factor of 1.2 at each
step.
The factor of 1.2 is the same factor used by Ghostview (upon which &mgv; is
based) and Ghostview borrowed the factor from TeX:  if 1.2 is good enough for Donald Knuth,
then it is certainly good enough for me.
<p>
The following entries are provided on the menu:
<descrip>
<tag/Decrease (Alt+-), Increase (Alt++)<label id="magstep-incdec">/
	Decrease or increase the magstep factor.
<p><tag/-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, Normal (Alt+0), +1, +2, +3, +4, +5<label id="magstep-numbers">/
	Set the magstep to the specified number; <em/normal/ means zero
	magnification.  The radio buttons are provided for convenient
	access to commonly used magsteps.  If none of the radio buttons
	are toggled on, then you have a magstep outside their range.
<p><tag/Set...<label id="magstep-set">/
	This pops up a simple dialog which allows you to set a specific
	magstep value.  The <em/Set Magstep/ dialog can be made
	<ref name="sticky" id="sticky-dialogs">.
</descrip>

The current magstep is displayed in, and can be changed from, the status line.

If the magstep is above +5 or below -5, then no radio button will be on but
the status line will still show the correct value.

<bf/Warning:/  High magsteps can be pretty hard on your machine:  <em/caveat
emptor/.  If you want to put an upper limit on the magstep, a simple
modification to <tt>magstep.c:mgv_ui_magnify()</tt> is all that is needed
(just don't make it less than 5 or you'll probably confuse the program).


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Orientation Menu<label id="orientation-menu"><p>
The <em/Orientation/ menu allows you to select the page orientation of
your document.  You may choose <em/Portrait/, <em/Landscape/,
<em/Upside-down/, or <em/Seascape/ as your orientation.

<em/Portrait/ is the <em/natural/ orientation for a given media; in most
cases, the short sides will be at the top and bottom.

<em/Landscape/ is a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees.
Some &ps; producers get things backwards and rotate counter-clockwise
so you might have to use the <em/Seascape/ orientation instead.

<em/Upside-down/ is a rotation of 180 degrees.
Note that this is not a reflection so <em/Upside-down/ may be misleading.

<em/Seascape/ is a clockwise rotation of 270 degrees.
Some &ps; documents that claim to be landscape have actually been
rotated by 90 degrees <em/counter-clockwise/ so you might have to use
this orientation to get a landscape document to appear right-side-up.

If you explicitly force an orientation, &mgv; will preserve it if you
reopen the current document.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Media Menu<label id="media-menu"><p>
The <em/Media/ menu allows you to select different paper sizes; if the
paper size can be determined from the &ps; file, then that paper size
will be selected by default, otherwise, the value of the <bf/defaultPageMedia/
resource (see <ref id="app-resources" name="Application Resources">) will be
used.

&mgv; understands the standard media from Adobe's PPD (sizes are listed
in points):  10x14 (720x1008), A3 (842x1190), A4 (595x842), A5 (420x595),
B4 (729x1032), B5 (516x729), Executive (540x720), Folio (612x936),
Ledger (1224x792), Legal (612x1008), Letter (612x792), Quarto (610x780),
Statement (396x612), and Tabloid (792x1224)
<em/Letter/ is the standard North American paper size, <em/A4/ is the
standard paper size in Europe (and probably the rest of the world).  One
inch is approximately 72 points, one centimeter is approximately 28.3 points.
<em/Letter/ and <em/Letter Small/ are the same size, <em/A4/ and <em/A4 Small/
are the same size.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Options Menu<label id="option-menu"><p>
The <em/Options/ menu is effectively a dumping ground for menu items
that don't belong in any of the other menus; the following items have
been abandoned here:
<descrip>
<tag>Enable Anti-aliasing (Ctrl+A)<label id="options-antialias"></tag>
	Enable or disable anti-aliasing within Ghostscript.
	Your copy of Ghostscript must support the <bf/x11alpha/ device if you want
	to use anti-aliasing.
	Note that anti-aliasing can make some &ps; files look worse (see
	<ref name="Caveats and Bugs" id="caveats-antialias">).
<p><tag>Enable Magic Scrolling (Alt+G)<label id="options-magicscrolling"></tag>
	Enable or disable <em/magic/ scrolling.  When magic scrolling is
	enabled, attempting to scroll down at the bottom of a page
	(or scroll up at the top of a page) will move you to the next
	(or previous) page. The <ref name="magicResistance"
	id="appres-magicResistance"> resource controls the number of attempts
	you have to make before magic scrolling takes effect.
<p><tag>Enable Smooth Scrolling (Alt+L)<label id="options-smoothscrolling"></tag>
	Enable or disable <em/smooth/ scrolling.  When smooth scrolling is
	enabled, scrolling with the <ref name="mgvScroll"
	id="action-mgvScroll"> action (i.e. with the arrow keys but not the
	little buttons on the scrollbars) will scroll the screen a couple
	pixels at a time with an update after each movement; this will give
	the scrolling a smoother appearance than the normal scrolling.
	When smooth scrolling is disabled, normal scrolling is performed.
	The <ref name="smoothScrolling" id="appres-smoothScrolling"> resource
	controls the initial state of smooth scrolling and the
	<ref name="smoothness" id="appres-smoothness"> resource controls
	how smooth the scrolling will be.  If you're interested in the
	scrolling, you might want to look at the <ref name="scrollPercentage"
	id="appres-scrollPercentage"> resource as well.
<p><tag>Enable Smart Sizing (Alt+Z)<label id="options-smartsizing"></tag>
	Enable or disable <em/smart sizing/.  The documentation for the
	<ref name="smartSizing" id="appres-smartSizing"> resource covers
	the smart sizing features and their limitations.  Note that
	smart sizing places upper limits on the main window size whereas
	<ref name="automatic sizing" id="page-autosize"> places lower
	limits on the main window size.
<p><tag>Color Palette<label id="options-palette"></tag>
	This sub-menu allows you to choose the color palette used for
	rendering files.
	You can choose from <em/Monochrome/, <em/Grayscale/, and <em/Color/
	palettes.
	Palette changes are not propagated to existing zoom windows but the
	new palette will be used by new zoom windows.
</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Help Menu<p>
The <em/Help/ menu provides access to the on-line help system via the
following entries:
<descrip>
<tag/Contents/<label id="help-contents">
	This entry will launch an HTML browser, set via the <bf/helpBrowser/
	resource (see <ref id="app-resources" name="Application Resources">),
	with the contents page.
<p><tag/On Context (F1)/<label id="help-context">
	This entry will change the mouse cursor to a question mark; if you
	click on a widget, an HTML browser will be launched with the 
	help entry for that widget.
	If the widget doesn't have any help text, the bell will be rung and
	no browser will get launched.
<p><tag/On Application Resources/<label id="help-appres">
	This entry will launch an HTML browser, set via the <bf/helpBrowser/
	resource, with the <ref id="app-resources" name="Application Resources">
	section.
<p><tag/On Command Line/<label id="help-cmdline">
	This entry will launch an HTML browser, set via the <bf/helpBrowser/
	resource (see <ref id="app-resources" name="Application Resources">),
	with the <ref id="switches" name="Command Line Switches"> section.
<p><tag/About/<label id="help-about">
	This will pop-up a dialog box with the &mgv; version, operating
	system, etc...
	If you encounter a bug, the information in this dialog may be
	useful to the author.
</descrip>
If you are using Netscape/remote or libhelp for on-line help,
then &mgv; will attempt to maintain a connection with the browser so that
only one instance of the browser will be required.  If you are using plain
HTML, then &mgv; will launch a separate browser for each help request.
Note that when &mgv; exits, it will attempt to kill (via <bf/SIGTERM/)
any browsers that it has launched (this can be changed by setting the
<ref name="killChildrenAtExit" id="appres-killChildrenAtExit"> resource
to <bf/False/), browsers that &mgv; has just borrowed will not be affected
by this.

<sect1>About Dialog<label id="help-aboutdlg"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="help-about">
	<img src="help-about.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>The About Box</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>The <em/About/ dialog contains the program name, a copyright statement,
author contact information, a
<em/Build Options/ button, and a <em/Dismiss/ button.
The <em/Dismiss/ button will remove the about box from the screen; if
the <em/Build Options/ dialog is also visible, it will be removed as well.
Activating the <em/Build Options/ button will pop up the <em/Build Options/
dialog (see <ref id="help-bldopts" name="Build Options Dialog">).

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>Build Options Dialog<label id="help-bldopts"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="help-bldopts">
	<img src="help-bldopts.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>Build Settings Dialog</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>The <em/Build Options/ dialog contains various flags and program names
used to compile the program;.
The entries are as follows:
<p><descrip>
<tag/version/
	The program version.
<p><tag/compile/
	The command used to compile source files, this command will include
	various macro definitions, includes paths, and sundry other compiler
	flags.
<p><tag/ldflags/
	Extra flags used to link the program.
<p><tag/libs/
	The libraries which the program was linked against.
<p><tag/uname/
	This line will contain the operating system name, release number,
	version, and machine type as specified by the operating system.
<p><tag/bindir/
	The binary installation directory.
<p><tag/datadir/
	The library installation directory.  Help files should be in
	the <tt/help/ subdirectory of <bf/datadir/.
<p><tag/build date/
	The data and time when the program was linked.
</descrip>
If you find a bug, the information in this dialog may be useful to the
maintainer.  You can also get this information using the <em/-version/
command line switch.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Popup Menu<label id="popup-menu"><p>
A popup menu is available anywhere in the main window by pressing mouse
button three; this menu contains the entries in the <ref name="View"
id="view-menu"> menu with the following additions:
<descrip>
<tag/Back (Alt+Left)/<label id="popup-back">
	Go to the previous page in the page history list; the previous
	page is the page you were at before the current page.
<p><tag/Forward (Alt+Right)/<label id="popup-forward">
	Go forward in the page history list.
</descrip>
The <em/Forward/ and <em/Back/ commands behave like <em/Forward/ and
<em/Back/ in most web browsers; the only difference is that the page
history list is initialized to a list of all the pages in the current
document.  There is currently no way to view the page history list, if
you really want such a feature send a request to the &mgv; author.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Tool Bar<label id="toolbar"><p>
<p>The &mgv; tool bar provides convenient access to various functions which
are available via the menus.  The functions available from the tool bar are
currently hard wired, there is no way add or remove buttons without chaning
the &mgv; source code.  However, various visual aspects of the tool bar
can be configured through the <ref name="resource database"
id="app-res.toolbar">.

Users can change the icons used in the tool bar by setting the
<ref name="toolBarIcon" id="appres-toolBarIcon"> resource on the tool bar
buttons.  If a tool bar icon cannot be found, the built-in default images
(Dobbs heads) will be used and a warning message will be printed to the
standard error stream.

<sect>Printing<label id="printing"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="file-print">
	<img src="file-print.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>Print Dialog</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>&mgv; has the ability to print an entire document or just selected pages.
Printing is accessed through the <em/Print/ button in the <em/File/ menu
which pops up a <em/Print/ dialog.  You can try and print a PDF file but
don't expect it to work unless your print spooler knows what to do with
PDF files.

The <em/Print/ dialog contains the following controls:
<itemize>
<item>
	A text field for specifying the print spooling command to use.
	The command should specify the printer to use and arguments
	to make it read from the standard input.
<item>
	A <em/Print Marked Pages Only/ toggle button.
	If this toggle is set, only the marked pages will be sent to the
	print spooler.
	This toggle is only active if there are marked pages.
<item>
	An <em/Unmark Pages After Printing/ toggle button.  If this toggle
	is set, the marked pages will be unmarked after the marked pages
	have been submitted to the print spooler.
	This toggle is only active if there are marked pages.
<item>
	A <em/Print/ button.  Pressing this button will submit the
	requested pages to the print spooler and pop down the <em/Print/
	dialog.
	Any output from the print spooler will be displayed in a message
	box.
<item>
	A <em/Help/ button for requesting help.
<item>
	A <em/Dismiss/ button for popping down the <em/Print/ dialog.
</itemize>
The default print command is taken from the <ref name="printCommand"
id="appres-printCommand"> application resource.
If you do not specify the <bf/printCommand/ resource,
&mgv; will attempt to choose sensible values; the manual entry for
the <ref name="printCommand" id="appres-printCommand"> resource discusses
the guessing procedure, the <bf/printCommand/ resource entry also lists
the restrictions on the print command.
The <em/Print/ dialog can be made <ref name="sticky"
id="sticky-dialogs">.

If the current document does not contain DSC comments, then you will
not be able to mark individual pages and hence, you will only be able
to print the entire document.

If your print spooler prints any status messages, a message box containing
the messages will be popped up.

<sect>Zooming<label id="zooming"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="main-zoom">
	<img src="main-zoom.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>Zoom Window</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>If you wish to magnify a section of the displayed image, you can either
magnify the entire image using the <ref name="Magstep Menu" id="menu-magstep">
or zoom in on a specific region using mouse button one.  Pressing mouse
button one and dragging will mark out the selected area; when the button
is released, a menu will popup with several zoom factors to choose from.
Of course you can zoom in on a zoom if you wish.

Note that resizing a zoom dialog stretches the area rather than expanding it.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Reading From The Standard Input<label id="stdin"><p>
If you run &mgv; without a file name or with a file name of &dquot;<tt/-/&dquot;
then one of two things will happen:
<itemize>
<item>If the standard input is a TTY, then &mgv; will just start up without
	a file.
<item>If the standard input is not a TTY, then &mgv; will attempt to read
	&ps; from the standard input.
</itemize>
This means that running &mgv; like this:
<verb>
	&dollar; mgv
</verb>
will just start an instance of &mgv; without a file;
if you run &mgv; like this:
<verb>
	&dollar; mgv somefile.ps
</verb>
then &mgv; will open <tt/somefile.ps/ as the initial file;
if you run &mgv; like this:
<verb>
	&dollar; mgv < somefile.ps
	&dollar; mgv - < somefile.ps
	&dollar; cat somefile.ps | mgv
	&dollar; cat somefile.ps | mgv -
</verb>
then &mgv; will end up reading <tt/somefile.ps/ from the standard input.
If you have asked &mgv; to copy files from the standard input using the
<ref name="copyStdin" id="appres-copyStdin"> resource, then &mgv; will
copy the standard input to a temporary file and work from the temporary
file. Note that if a file is read from standard input and not copied,
you will only be able to move to the next page: you won't be able to
jump to an arbitrary page and you won't be able to move backwards.

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Sticky Dialogs<label id="sticky-dialogs"><p>
Some of the dialogs in &mgv; can be configured to require explicit user
action to dismiss them; generally, the dialogs will dismiss themselves
after you press the <em/OK/ or <em/Apply/ button but some users dislike
this behavior.  If you prefer to keep dialogs up until you explicitly
dismiss them (via <em/Cancel/ or <em/Dismiss/ buttons), then you can
use the <bf/wlAutoDismiss/ resource to keep the dialogs up (note that all
of the dialogs in &mgv; are modeless so keeping the dialogs up will not
interfere with normal application usage).

You can make all of the sticky-enabled dialogs sticky by setting the
<bf/wlAutoDismiss/ resource to <bf/False/ with something like this:
<verb>
	mgv*wlAutoDismiss: False
</verb>
in your local resource file (probably
&dquot;<tt>&tilde;/.Xresources</tt>&dquot;) or from the command line:
<verb>
	mgv -xrm 'mgv*wlAutoDismiss: False'
</verb>

The following dialogs can be made sticky:
<itemize>
<item><ref name="File Save" id="file-save">
	(&dquot;<tt>mgv*fileSave.wlAutoDismiss: False</tt>&dquot;)
<item><ref name="Set Magstep" id="magstep-set">
	(&dquot;<tt>mgv*magstepDialog.wlAutoDismiss: False</tt>&dquot;)
<item><ref name="Print" id="printing">
	(&dquot;<tt>mgv*printDialog.wlAutoDismiss: False</tt>&dquot;)
</itemize>
The <ref name="File Open" id="file-open"> dialog offers similar functionality
through its <em/Browse/ toggle.

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Ghostscript Message Log<label id="gs-log"><p>
<figure>
	<eps file="gs-log">
	<img src="gs-log.gif">
	<![ %fmttex; [ <caption>Ghostscript Message Log</caption> ]]>
</figure>
<p>All messages from Ghostscript are stored in a log dialog.
By default this dialog is not visible but may be viewed at any time using
the <em/Hide Log/ entry in the <ref id="view-menu" name="View Menu">.
The <ref name="hideLog" id="appres-hideLog"> application resource may be
used to alter the default behavior for all instances of &mgv; and the
<bf/-log/ and <bf/-nolog/ command-line switches (see <ref id="switches"
name="Command Line Switches">) may be used to alter the default behavior
for a single execution.  The message log is also used to display errors
from the Ghostscript interpreter.  If there is an error, the log will
automatically pop up.

The log dialog consists of the following widgets:
<itemize>
<item>
	A Scrolled text region for displaying the messages.  The text widget
	is editable so you are free to add notes if you find a bug in
	&mgv;, Ghostscript, or someone's &ps; program.
<item>
	A <em/Hide/ button for popping down the log until an error occurs or
	you explicitly request its presence again.
<item>
	A <em/Save/ button for saving the current contents of the log to
	a file.  This button will activate a standard file selector to ask
	for the filename.
<item>
	A <em/Clear/ button for emptying the log.
<item>
	A <em/Help/ button for requesting help on the log dialog.
</itemize>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Application Resources<label id="app-resources"><p>
The following sections detail the &mgv; application resources.
Each resource name is followed by its type and the resource class name
in parentheses.  All resource settings should have the form:
<verb>
	mgv*resourceName: value
</verb>
to make sure the resource gets to the proper widget.

<sect1>Help Resources<label id="app-res.help"><p>
The following resource control various aspects of the on-line help
system:
<descrip>
<tag>helpBrowser String (HelpBrowser)<label id="appres-helpBrowser"></tag>
	This resource specifies the HTML browser to use for on-line help.
	The HTML files used by <bf/wlib/ are quite generic so
	any HTML browser should work.
	Note that the browser will be given a <em/-display display/ argument
	before the actual URL so the browser that you use should understand
	this standard <bf/X/ option.

	The <bf/helpType/ resource should agree with your chosen browser.
<p><tag>helpPrefix String (HelpPrefix)<label id="appres-helpPrefix"></tag>
	The help prefix serves as the root of the HTML documentation tree.
	If the help files are installed locally, then this will be the full
	path (including the trailing slash) to the directory containing the
	help files.
	If you are accessing the help files through an HTTP server, then this
	resource should have the form
	<bf>http://hostname/path/to/help/files/</>.  If you are using
	a <bf/helpType/ of <bf/libhelp/, then the help files must
	be accessible from the file system.
<p><tag>helpType String (HelpType)<label id="appres-helpType"></tag>
	This resource specifies your preferred on-line help format.
	The following types are known:
	<p><descrip>
	<tag/html/
		Plain old HTML with no communication with the browser.
		This help method will launch a separate browser for
		each help request.
	<p><tag/html-remote, netscape, remote/
		HTML with Netscape's <bf/-remote/ protocol.
	<p><tag/libhelp/
		The libhelp help system.  If you wish to use libhelp for
		online help then you should make sure that your
		<bf/LIBHELPPATH/ environment variable contains a path
		to the libhelp images; the application will add its own
		entries to <bf/LIBHELPPATH/ based on the <bf/helpPrefix/
		resource so you should make sure that <bf/helpPrefix/
		is correctly set.
		See
		<url url="http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ipvr/bv/personen/mache/libhelp"
		name="http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ipvr/bv/personen/mache/libhelp">
		for more information about libhelp.  This is the lightest
		weight help system currently supported so I recommend that
		you use it if possible.
	</descrip>
	<p>All help methods except <bf/html/ will attempt to maintain a
	connection to the help browser used so that only one instance of
	the help browser will be used.
	Not all help methods are supported on all platforms but the
	three HTML methods should always be available (assuming the
	availability of browsers).
	If you supply an unknown help type a warning message will be printed
	on standard error and <bf/html/ will be used.

	The <bf/helpBrowser/ resource should agree with your chosen help
	type.
</descrip>

<sect1>Rendering Resources<label id="app-res.rendering"><p>
The following resources control the actual &ps; rendering process and
supply various rendering defaults.  Most of these resources are converted
to switches for the child Ghostscript that does all of the real work.
<descrip>
<tag>antialias Boolean (Antialias)<label id="appres-antialias"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/true/ then &ps; files will be anti-aliased
	to improve image quality (at the expense of performance).  Your
	Ghostscript must support the <bf/x11alpha/ device or anti-aliasing won't
	work.  If anti-aliasing is enable, then the <bf/x11alpha/ device is
	used and Ghostscript will be run with the <em/-dNOPLATFONTS/ switch; if
	anti-aliasing is disabled, then the <bf/x11/ device will be used.
	The default value is <bf/true/.
<p><tag>antialiasEPS Boolean (AntialiasEPS)<label id="appres-antialiasEPS"></tag>
	Anti-aliasing graphic images (which seems to be what most EPS
	files contain) will often produce a poorer quality display
	and significantly increase the rendering time.
	If you find yourself disabling anti-aliasing by hand whenever
	you open an EPS file, then this resource is for you.
	If you disable anti-aliasing globally, then this resource
	is irrelevant.
	If you enable anti-aliasing globally, then this resource is only
	relevant if its value is <bf/False/; in this case, anti-aliasing
	will automatically be disabled when you load an EPS file and, of
	course, reset to the previous state when you load a non-EPS file.
	The default value is <bf/True/ which means that EPS files will
	be treated like any other &ps; file so that anti-aliasing of
	EPS files will be controlled by the <bf/antialias/ resource
	of the Ghostview widget.
<p><tag>arguments String (Arguments)<label id="appres-arguments"></tag>
	This resource is used to supply extra command-line switches
	to Ghostscript.  This resource is useful for passing <em/-I/ switches
	to Ghostscript when your library files are not where Ghostscript
	thinks they are.  The default value is empty.
<p><tag>defaultPageMedia String (DefaultPageMedia)<label id="appres-defaultPageMedia"></tag>
	This resource sets the media for documents that do not specify
	one with a <tt/&percnt;&percnt;BoundingBox/ or
	<tt/&percnt;&percnt;PageMedia/ comment.
	All of the values in the <ref name="Media Menu" id="media-menu">
	are valid values for this resource and the values are case
	insensitive.  The default is <bf/Letter/.
<p><tag>gsLocale String (GsLocale)<label id="appres-gsLocale"></tag>
	This resource supplies the locale used when writing the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/
	window property.  In order to support multiple locales, &mgv; calls
	<bf/XtSetLanguageProc()/ and this might put you into a non POSIX
	locale; using a non-POSIX locale can alter the decimal separator
	so that commas are used where Ghostscript expects periods.  By default,
	&mgv; temporarily forces a POSIX locale while building the the
	property string but your copy of Ghostscript may be expecting something
	else.  If Ghostscript is having problems parsing the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/
	property, then you should try adjusting this resource.
<p><tag>interpreter String (Interpreter)<label id="appres-interpreter"></tag>
	Specify where your Ghostscript lives.  If you don't specify a particular
	Ghostscript, &mgv; will use the first one that shows up in your
	<bf/PATH/ environment variable.
<p><tag>magstep Integer (Magstep)<label id="appres-magstep"></tag>
	This resource specifies the initial <ref name="magstep"
	id="menu-magstep">.  The default value is zero.
</descrip>

<sect1>Display Resources<label id="app-res.display"><p>
The following resources control which parts of the &mgv; user interface
will be displayed at start up:
<descrip>
<tag>hideLog Boolean (HideLog)<label id="appres-hideLog"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/ then the Ghostscript message log will be
	hidden by default.
	Any errors from Ghostscript will force the log to be displayed.
	Messages from Ghostscript will be logged even if the log is hidden.
	The default value is <bf/True/.
	Note that the log does not exist until there is something to put
	in it.
<p><tag>hideMenuBar Boolean (HideMenuBar)<label id="appres-hideMenuBar"></tag>
	This resource controls the initial state of the menu bar; if set
	to <bf/True/, the menu bar will be hidden at start up and the
	menu bar will be visible at start up if this resource is <bf/False/.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
<p><tag>hidePageList Boolean (HidePageList)<label id="appres-hidePageList"></tag>
	When this resource is <bf/False/, the page list will be visible at
	start up and the page list will be hidden if this resource is set
	to <bf/True/.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
<p><tag>hideStatusLine Boolean (HideStatusLine)<label id="appres-hideStatusLine"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/, the status line will be hidden at
	start up; if this resource is <bf/False/, the status line will be
	visible at start up.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
<p><tag>hideToolBar Boolean (HideToolBar)<label id="appres-hideToolBar"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/, the tool bar will be hidden at
	start up; if this resource is <bf/False/, the tool bar will be
	visible at start up.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
<p><tag>showLabels Boolean (ShowLabels)<label id="appres-showLabels"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/ then the page labels, if any, will be
	displayed in the page list; if <bf/showPageNumbers/ is also <bf/True/
	then both will be displayed.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
<p><tag>showPageNumbers Boolean (ShowPageNumbers)<label id="appres-showPageNumbers"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/ then the page numbers, if any, will be
	displayed in the pagelist; if <bf/showLabels/ is also <bf/True/
	then both will be displayed.
	The default value is <bf/True/.
</descrip>

<sect1>Colormap Resources<label id="app-res.colormap"><p>
The following resources control such things as private color maps and
non-default visuals.  If you're running out of colors, there may be some
help for you here.
<descrip>
<tag>wlDepth Integer (WlDepth)<label id="appres-wlDepth"></tag>
	Specify a non-default color depth.
<p><tag>wlUsePrivateColormap Boolean (WlUsePrivateColormap)<label id="appres-wlUsePrivateColormap"></tag>
	Install a private colormap if <bf/true/, otherwise use the default
	colormap.  If you specify a non-default visual or depth, you will get
	a private colormap whether you ask for one or not.
<p><tag>wlVisualClass WlVisualClass (WlVisualClass)<label id="appres-wlVisualClass"></tag>
	Specify a non-default visual by visual class.  The value of this
	resource can be any of the following strings (case insensitive):

	<descrip>
	<tag/StaticGray/
		This visual yields a hardware defined read-only grayscale
		palette, the colors cannot be changed to suit the application's
		needs.
	<p><tag/StaticColor/
		This visual yields a hardware defined read-only color
		palette, the colors cannot be changed to suit the application's
		needs.
	<p><tag/PseudoColor/
		This visual yields an indexed read/write palette, the colors
		may be modified to suit an application's needs.
		This is the most common visual on eight bit color displays.
	<p><tag/GrayScale, GreyScale/
		This visual yields an indexed read/write palette where the
		red, green, and blue components of each color are equal.
	<p><tag/TrueColor/
		This visual yields a hardware defined, non-indexed,
		read-only palette.
	<p><tag/DirectColor/
		This visual is a high-performance visual where the red,
		green, and blue color components are separately indexed.
		The palette is read/write.
	</descrip>
	<p>Not all visual classes are available with all servers, the
	<bf/xdpyinfo/ command will tell you which visuals are available.
	If you don't know what any of the descriptions mean, you should
	experiment to find the visual which you like best and bug the
	author (&EMAIL;) to clarify the documentation.  If you aren't
	having any problems with your colormaps, then you should probably
	just use the defaults and leave these resources alone.

	You might want to set the <bf/wlDepth/ resource as well.
<p><tag>wlVisualID String (WlVisualID)<label id="appres-wlVisualID"></tag>
	Specify a non-default visual by visual id.
	This resource takes precedence over the <bf/wlDepth/ and
	<bf/wlVisualClass/ resources.  This resource is available in
	case the visual chosen by the <bf/wlDepth/ and <bf/wlVisualClass/
	resources is not the one you want--you should only use
	this resource if <bf/wlDepth/ and <bf/wlVisualClass/ are not giving
	the visual you want.
</descrip>
The final visual, depth, and colormap are chosen as follows:
<enum>
<item>
	If the <bf/wlVisualID/ is set and it contains a valid visual,
	then we use that.
<item>
	If <bf/wlDepth/ and <bf/wlVisualClass/ are set, then we try and
	find a visual with the desired depth and class.  If this fails,
	the defaults are used.  If only <bf/wlDepth/ is set, then we use
	the first available visual which supports that depth.
<item>
	If <bf/wlVisualClass/ is set but <bf/wlDepth/ is not, we use the
	visual of the specified class which has the largest depth.
<item>
	If all else fails (or nothing special is requested), then the
	defaults supplied by Xt are used.
</enum>
If <bf/wlUsePrivateColormap/ is <bf/true/ or the visual requires a private
colormap, then a private colormap is used.  Normally you can just specify the
<bf/wlVisualClass/ and <bf/wlDepth/ (after looking at the output of
<bf/xdpyinfo/(1) first) and you'll get what you want, if that doesn't work,
just specify the visual ID in <bf/wlVisualID/.

<sect1>Scrolling Resources<label id="app-res.scrolling"><p>
The following resource affect various aspects of scrolling in &mgv;:
<descrip>
<tag>center String (Center)<label id="appres-center"></tag>
	When this resource is <bf/True/, pages will be centered when
	displayed.  The default value is <bf/False/.  You can also
	enable or disable page centering at run-time with the
	<ref name="Center" id="page-center"> menu entry.
<p><tag>magicResistance Integer (MagicResistance)<label id="appres-magicResistance"></tag>
	This resource specifies the number of consecutive attempts to scroll
	beyond the page boundaries that are needed before magic scrolling
	takes effect.  This resource has no effect if magic scrolling is
	not enabled.  The absolute value of this resource is used.  If you
	want no resistance at all (i.e. magic happens as soon as you try
	to exceed the page boundary), use a value of zero.
	The default value is <bf/2/ (i.e. the second attempt succeeds).

	The documentation for the <ref name="mgvScroll" id="action-mgvScroll">
	contains some more notes about scrolling in general.
<p><tag>magicScrolling Boolean (MagicScrolling)<label id="appres-magicScrolling"></tag>
	When this resource is <bf/True/, &mgv; will move to the next page
	if you try and scroll down at the bottom of a page and move to the
	previous page if you try and scroll up at the top of a page.
	You can change this behavior at run-time via the
	<ref name="Option" id="option-menu"> menu.
	The default value is <bf/True/.
<p><tag>resetScrollBars ResetScrollBars (ResetScrollBars)<label id="appres-resetScrollBars"></tag>
	This resource controls the resetting of the horizontal and vertical
	scrollbars in the main window when you change pages; the possible
	values are
	<itemize>
	<item><bf/both, all/: reset both the horizontal and vertical
		scrollbars.  The value <bf/true/ is an alias for <bf/both/
		in the interests of backwards compatibility.
	<item><bf/none/: don't reset either scrollbar.  The value <bf/false/
		is an alias for <bf/none/ in the interests of backwards
		compatibility.
	<item><bf/horizontal/: reset the horizontal scrollbar.
	<item><bf/vertical/: reset the vertical scrollbar.
	</itemize>
	All of these values are case-insensitive.
	When this resource is used, the chosen scrollbars will be moved
	back to their home positions (the top or left edge) when you change
	pages.
	Note that changing the orientation or media type will always reset both
	scrollbars.  The default value is <bf/both/.
<p><tag>scrollPercentage Percentage (ScrollPercentage)<label id="appres-scrollPercentage"></tag>
	This resource controls how far the page will move when you scroll
	with the <ref name="mgvScroll" id="action-mgvScroll"> action (i.e.
	the keyboard but not the little buttons on the scrollbars).  A
	value of <bf/100&percnt;/ will scroll a whole window height/width
	while a value of <bf/90&percnt;/ (the default) will leave a little
	bit of overlap for context.  If the value you specify has a trailing
	percent sign (&dquot;<em/&percnt;/&dquot;), then it will be
	interpreted as a percentage (i.e. the value will be divided by 100),
	otherwise, the value will be considered a raw floating point value.
	For example:  <em/75&percnt;/, <em/.75/, and <em/7.5e-1/ all represent
	the same value.
<p><tag>smoothScrolling Boolean (SmoothScrolling)<label id="appres-smoothScrolling"></tag>
	This resource controls the smooth scrolling in the main viewing
	window.  When smooth scrolling is enabled, scrolling with the
	<ref name="mgvScroll" id="action-mgvScroll"> action (i.e. with the
	arrow keys but not the little buttons on the scrollbars) will scroll
	the screen a couple pixels at a time with an update after each
	movement; this will give the scrolling a smoother appearance than the
	normal scrolling.  When smooth scrolling is disabled, the normal
	scrolling is performed.  Smooth scrolling makes it much easier to
	keep track of where you are on the page but it is slower:
	<em/caveat emptor/.  Smooth scrolling can be turned on and off at
	run time from the <ref name="Options" id="options-smoothscrolling">
	menu.  Smooth scrolling is enabled by default.
<p><tag>smoothness Integer (Smoothness)<label id="appres-smoothness"></tag>
	This resource controls how smooth smooth scrolling will be;
	the normal increment (see the <bf/scrollPercentage/ resource)
	is divided by
	the value of this resource to determine how many pixels to
	scroll between screen updates.
	Larger values will yield smoother scrolling but will take more
	time.
	Values between 20 and 30 tend give fairly good results
	(this is dependent on how fast your machine and X server are).
	The default value is <bf/25/.
</descrip>

<sect1>Sizing Resources<label id="app-res.sizing"><p>
The following resources control how &mgv; resizes the main window to
accomodate the page size of a &ps; file.
<descrip>
<tag>autoHeight Boolean (AutoHeight)<label id="appres-autoHeight"></tag>
	If the this resource is <bf/True/ then &mgv; will attempt
	to make the main window tall enough to display an entire page;
	your window manager may refuse the request but &mgv; will try
	anyway.  This resource is <bf/False/ by default.
<p><tag>autoWidth Boolean (AutoWidth)<label id="appres-autoWidth"></tag>
	If the this resource is <bf/True/ then &mgv; will attempt
	to make the main window wide enough to display an entire page;
	your window manager may refuse the request but &mgv; will try
	anyway.  This resource is <bf/True/ by default.
<p><tag>smartSizing Boolean (SmartSizing)<label id="appres-smartSizing"></tag>
	This resource controls how smart the <ref name="automatic sizing"
	id="page-autosize"> will be.  If this resource is <bf/True/, then
	&mgv; will attempt to keep the window smaller than the screen during
	automatic resizing; if <bf/False/, &mgv; will leave this task to
	your window manager.
	The default is <bf/False/ since this stuff is really your window
	manager's problem.

	You should only need to use the <bf/smartSizing/ resource if your
	window manager allows windows to exceed the screen size.  If you
	need to use this resource, you should set the <ref id="appres-wmWidth"
	name="wmWidth and wmHeight"> resources since there is no sane way
	to get determine how large the window manager decorations are.
<p><tag>wmHeight Integer (WmHeight)<label id="appres-wmHeight"></tag>
	This resource specifies the height (top and bottom combined) of the
	window manager decorations.  You will only need to care about
	this resource if you need to use the <ref name="smartSizing"
	id="appres-smartSizing"> resource.  The default value of
	<bf/30/ is most likely incorrect for your system; the easiest
	way of finding the correct value is to run
	&dquot;<tt>xwininfo</tt>&dquot; and
	&dquot;<tt>xwininfo -frame</tt>&dquot; and use the difference between
	the reported <bf/Height/ values.
<p><tag>wmWidth Integer (WmWidth)<label id="appres-wmWidth"></tag>
	This resource specifies the width (both sides combined) of the
	window manager decorations.  You will only need to care about
	this resource if you need to use the <ref name="smartSizing"
	id="appres-smartSizing"> resource.  The default value of
	<bf/12/ is most likely incorrect for your system; the easiest
	way of finding the correct value is to run
	&dquot;<tt>xwininfo</tt>&dquot; and
	&dquot <tt>xwininfo -frame</tt>&dquot; and use the difference between
	the reported <bf/Width/ values.
</descrip>

<sect1>Splash Screen and Icon Resources<label id="app-res.splash"><p>
The following resources control the &mgv; splash screen and window manager
icon.
<descrip>
<tag>wlInstallIcon Boolean (WlInstallIcon)<label id="appres-wlInstallIcon"></tag>
	This resource tells the application to install or not install its own
	built-in icon when it runs.  If you have your own cool icon that
	matches your personal desktop better than the built-in icon you can
	set this resource to <bf/false/ and tell your window manager to use
	your preferred icon.  This resource is <bf/true/ by default.
<p><tag>wlSplashBitmap String (WlSplashBitmap)<label id="appres-wlSplashBitmap"></tag>
	The full path to your desired splash screen as an XBM file.
<p><tag>wlSplashPixmap String (WlSplashPixmap)<label id="appres-wlSplashPixmap"></tag>
	The full path to your desired splash screen as an XPM file.  If the
	file doesn't exist or cannot be loaded, then the bitmap will be tried.
<p><tag>wlShowSplashScreen Boolean (WlShowSplashScreen)<label id="appres-wlShowSplashScreen"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/, the splash screen will be shown; if
	this resource is <bf/False/, the splash screen will not be shown.
	The internal default is <bf/False/ but the application defaults file
	will probably specify <bf/True/.
<p><tag>wlUseColorIcon Boolean (WlUseColorIcon)<label id="appres-wlUseColorIcon"></tag>
	Use or don't use a color icon.  If the color icon is not available
	(due to a lack of Xpm support), then the monochrome icon will be
	used.  The default value for this resource is <bf/true/.
<p><tag>wlUseMonoSplash Boolean (WlUseMonoSplash)<label id="appres-wlUseMonoSplash"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/, then the application will show the
	monochrome splash screen without even trying to show the color
	one.  Normally, the application will try the color splash screen
	(as specified by the <ref name="wlSplashPixmap"
	id="appres-wlSplashPixmap"> resource) and then try the monochrome
	splash screen (as specified by the <ref name="wlSplashBitmap"
	id="appres-wlSplashBitmap"> resource) if that doesn't work.
	The default value is <bf/False/.
</descrip>

<sect1>Tool Bar Resources<label id="app-res.toolbar"><p>
The following resources control various aspects of the &mgv; toolbar.
<descrip>

	<bf/1/.
<p><tag>flattenButtons Boolean (FlattenButtons)<label id="appres-flattenButtons"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/, the toolbar buttons will appear flat
	until the mouse passes over them, when the mouse enters one of the
	buttons, it will <em/pop up/ (i.e. its shadow will be drawn).  If
	this resource is <bf/False/, the toolbar buttons will look and act
	like every other button.  The default value is <bf/True/.
<p><tag>groupSpacing Dimension (GroupSpacing)<label id="appres-groupSpacing"></tag>
	The amount of space between groups of buttons (see <ref name="newGroup"
	id="appres-newGroup">).  The default value is <bf/10/ pixels.
<p><tag>showToolTips Boolean (ShowToolTips)<label id="appres-showToolTips"></tag>

	standard Motif default font list.
<p><tag>tipForeground Color (TipForeground)<label id="appres-tipForeground"></tag>
	The foreground color for tool tips.  The default is <bf/black/.
<p><tag>tipPosition TipPosition (TipPosition)<label id="appres-tipPosition"></tag>

	This resource may have one of the following values:
	<itemize>
	<item><bf/bottom-left/
	<item><bf/bottom-right/
	<item><bf/top-left/
	<item><bf/top-right/
	</itemize>
	The values may be specified with a <bf/tip-/, <bf/wltip-/,
	<bf/xwltip-/, or <bf/xmtip-/ prefix and underscores may be used
	instead of hyphens.  The default value is <bf/bottom-left/.
<p><tag>useColorIcons Boolean (UseColorIcons)<label id="appres-useColorIcons"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/ then &mgv; will attempt to use color
	icons in the toolbar, if <bf/False/ then monochrome images will be
	used.  If your copy of &mgv; was compiled without XPM support then
	you will get monochrome toolbar icons even if this resource is
	<bf/True/.  The default value is <bf/True/.
</descrip>

The following resources can be set on the tool bar buttons:
<descrip>
<tag>newGroup Boolean (NewGroup)<label id="appres-newGroup"></tag>
	Mark a button as the start of a new group of buttons.  Button
	groups are separated by <ref name="groupSpacing"
	id="appres-groupSpacing"> extra space.  The default value is
	<bf/False/.
<p><tag>toolBarIcon String (ToolBarIcon)<label id="appres-toolBarIcon"></tag>
	The name of the icon to use for this button.  This resource specifies
	a name which is used to construct file names or a value in an internal
	icon table.  If the name begins with <bf/INTERNAL::/ then the list
	of compiled-in icons is used to find the icon, otherwise, the name
	should specify a full path to your desired icon without the 
	<tt/.xpm/ or <tt/.xbm/ extension:  the extension will be appended
	by &mgv;.  The insensitive icon image file should have a <bf/-i/
	suffix; for example:  if the image name is <tt/someIcon/, then the
	sensitive pixmap would be <tt/someIcon.xpm/ and the insensitive
	pixmap would be <tt/someIcon-i.xpm/.
	Color icons should be in XPM format, monochrome icons in XBM format.
	For color icons, you can use the <em/None/ and <em/none/ color
	symbols to indicate transparency (the GIMP, at least, uses these
	symbols in transparent XPM files).
<p><tag>toolTip String (ToolTip)<label id="appres-toolTip"></tag>
	The tool tip to display for this button.  The default value is
	an empty string.
</descrip>

The following list contains resources which don't fit in any of the
other categories:
<descrip>
<tag>applicationVersion String (ApplicationVersion)<label id="appres-applicationVersion"></tag>
	This resource holds the application version number.  &mgv; uses
	the value of this resource to check the version of the application
	defaults files that gets used.  If the incorrect version is found,
	&mgv; will warn you to expect strange behavior.  If this occurs,
	then you have the wrong version of the application defaults installed
	somewhere and you should remove or replace it.
	<quote><bf>
		You should never alter the value of this resource.
	</bf></quote>
<p><tag>bunzip String (Bunzip)<label id="appres-bunzip"></tag>

	will be used to decompress bzip2ed files; the command must
	read from the standard input and write to the standard output.
	By default this resource is set to <bf/&dquot;bunzip2&dquot;/.
<p><tag>bzip String (Bzip)<label id="appres-bzip"></tag>
	This resource contains the command (including arguments) that
	will be used to compress files with bzip2; the command

	This resource contains the command (including arguments) that
	will be used to compress files with compress; the command
	must read from the standard input and write to the standard output.
	This resource defaults to <bf/&dquot;compress&dquot;/.
<p><tag>confirmExit Boolean (ConfirmExit)<label id="appres-confirmExit"></tag>
	If this resource is <bf/True/ and you have multiple top level
	viewing windows when you issue an exit request (through the
	<em/Exit/ entry in the <em/File/ menu), you will be prompted to
	confirm that you really meant it; note that this resource only has
	an effect when you have more than one viewing window.
	The default is <bf/True/.
<p><tag>copyStdin Boolean (CopyStdin)<label id="appres-copyStdin"></tag>
	This resource controls whether or not &ps; files read from the
	standard input are copied to temporary files.  If you don't copy
	the standard input then you won't get page navigation; however,
	if the file you're reading from the standard input is quite large
	you may wish to give up page navigation to avoid running out of
	temporary file space.  This resource is <bf/True/ by default.
<p><tag>decompress String (Decompress)<label id="appres-decompress"></tag>
	This resource contains the command (including arguments) that
	will be used to decompress compressed files; the command must
	read from the standard input and write to the standard output.

	This resource contains the command (including arguments) that
	will be used to compress files with gzip; the command
	must read from the standard input and write to the standard output.
	This resource defaults to <bf/&dquot;gzip -9&dquot;/.
<p><tag>killChildrenAtExit Boolean (KillChildrenAtExit)<label id="appres-killChildrenAtExit"></tag>
	When this resource is <bf/True/, all child processes (which for now
	are just the HTML browsers) will be killed, using <bf/SIGTERM/,
	when &mgv; exits; if this resource is <bf/False/, then the children
	will be left alone.  Note that Ghostscript children will always be
	killed.
	By default this resource is <bf/True/.
<p><tag>printCommand String (PrintCommand)<label id="appres-printCommand"></tag>
	The command for your printer spooler.
	If you don't specify this resource, &mgv; will attempt to determine
	it automatically by looking for <bf/lp/ in your <bf/PATH/ environment
	variable and if <bf/lp/ cannot be found, it will search for <bf/lpr/.
	The <bf/printCommand/ does not understand shell quoting, the command
	will be broken into arguments at white space boundaries; if you really
	need to supply quoted arguments to your print command, then you'll
	have to write a shell script wrapper.

	the print command.
<p><tag>reticuleForeground Color (ReticuleForeground)<label id="appres-reticuleForeground"></tag>

	This resource specifies where temporary files should be stored.
	If this resource is not specified, &mgv; will use the directory
	specified in first available source from the following list:

	<item>	the <bf/TEMPDIR/ environment variable
	<item>	the standard temporary directory for your system
		(<bf/P_tmpdir/ in <tt/stdio.h/ or
		&dquot;<tt>/usr/tmp</tt>&dquot; if there is no <bf/P_tmpdir/).
	<item>	<tt>/tmp/</>.
	</itemize>
	For convenience, &mgv; will create its own directory under the
	specified directory.
<p><tag>wlUseEditRes Boolean (WlUseEditRes)<label id="appres-wlUseEditRes"></tag>
	This resource controls whether support for the editres protocol
	will be installed in application shell widgets.  If <bf/wlUseEditRes/

</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>The Application Defaults File<p>
By default the &mgv; application defaults file is installed in the &mgv;
library directory for future reference--the application defaults is not
needed since the entire application defaults file is compiled into &mgv;
as fallback resources.  However, you may, if you wish, install the
application defaults file in the normal location (probably
<tt>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults</tt> or <tt>/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults</tt>)
and everything should work just fine until the next &mgv; upgrade.

I stopped installing the application defaults file in the app-defaults
directory to avoid version conflicts:  an incorrect application defaults
file can seriously break &mgv;.  &mgv; will detect an out-of-date application
defaults file and warn you about it.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Actions<p>
The following actions are defined by &mgv;:
<descrip>
<tag>mgvMark()<label id="action-mgvMark"></tag>
	Toggle the marked status of a page; this action is only valid in
	the main page list.  This action takes no arguments.  This action
	is bound to <bf/Shift-Button1/ by default.
<p><tag>mgvPan(<em/command/)<label id="action-mgvPan"></tag>
	This action scrolls the main viewing window in two dimensions.
	The argument should be <bf/begin/, <bf/pan/, or <bf/end/;
	<bf/begin/ starts the panning, <bf/pan/ causes the window to
	scroll, and <bf/end/ stops the panning.  These commands are bound
	to <bf/Btn2Down/, <bf/Btn2Motion/, and <bf/Btn2Up/ (respectively)
	by default.
<p><tag>mgvScroll(<em/direction/ &lsqb;, <em/magical/ &lsqb;, <em/force/ &rsqb; &rsqb;)<label id="action-mgvScroll"></tag>
	This action scrolls the main viewing window; the action has
	one, two, or three arguments.
	The first argument should be the scrolling direction (<bf/up/,
	<bf/down/, <bf/left/, or <bf/right/), the second (optional)
	argument should be <bf/magical/ or non-existent--the scrolling
	will be <ref id="options-magicscrolling" name="magical"> if the
	second argument is <bf/magical/.  If you specify the
	second argument, you can also specify the third argument
	which indicates how many scrolling attempts this should count
	for; the absolute value of this parameter is used so the sign
	of <em/force/ makes no difference; a value of zero is considered
	to be one (which is also the default value).
	<p>
	You can use the third argument to attach different levels of
	<em/magicalness/ to different keys.  For example, if your
	<bf/magicResistance/ is <bf/3/ and you add these bindings:
	<verb>
	<Key>space:		mgvScroll(down, magical, 3)
	<Key>osfBackSpace:	mgvScroll(up,   magical, 3)
	</verb>
	then the spacebar will always scroll down magically and the
	backspace key will always scroll up magically.

	This action will scroll smoothly if smooth scrolling is
	enabled.
<p><tag>mgvZoom(<em/command/)<label id="action-mgvZoom"></tag>
	Begin, extend, or end a zoom reticule.  This action takes one
	argument which must be one of:  <bf/begin/ (begin a new zoom reticule
	at the current mouse position), <bf/end/ (end the current zoom
	reticule at the current mouse position), or <bf/extend/ (extend the
	current zoom reticule).
<p><tag>wlHelpContext()<label id="action-wlHelpContext"></tag>
	This action activates the context sensitive help system; the
	cursor will turn into a question mark so you can select the
	widget you want help with.  This action is normally bound to
	the <bf/osfHelp/ virtual key (which is generally <bf/F1/).
</descrip>
All arguments are case insensitive.  Arguments in (square) brackets are
optional.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Command Line Switches<label id="switches"><p>
The command line switches for &mgv; generally set application resources;
see <ref id="app-resources" name="Application Resources"> for descriptions
of the various resources.

<sect1>Help Switches<label id="switches.help"><p>
<descrip>
<tag/-browser htmlbrowser/
	Specify the HTML browser to use for the on-line help; this switch
	sets the <ref name="helpBrowser" id="appres-helpBrowser"> resource.
<p><tag/-help, --help, -H, -?/
	Display a short summary of the available command line switches.
<p><tag/-helptype type/
	Specify the help type for on-line help.  This switch sets the
	<ref name="helpType" id="appres-helpType"> resource to <bf/type/.
<p><tag/-longhelp/
	Display a summary, with explanations, of the available command line
	switches.
<p><tag/-prefix pfx/
	Specify the location of the files for the on-line help; this
	switch sets the <ref name="helpPrefix" id="appres-helpPrefix">
	resource.
<p><tag/-version, --version/
	Display lots of version and build information about &mgv;.
	The displayed information is the same as that in 
	the <ref id="help-bldopts" name="Build Options Dialog">.
</descrip>

<sect1>Rendering Switches<label id="switches.rendering"><p>
<descrip>
<tag/-aliaseps, -noaliaseps/
	Anti-aliasing graphic images will often make the images look worse
	and increase the rendering time significantly; hence, these switches
	are offered to give you finer control over when anti-aliasing is
	used.  These switches set the <ref name="antialiasEPS"
	id="appres-antialiasEPS"> application resource.
<p><tag/-antialias, -noantialias/
	Enable or disable anti-aliasing within Ghostscript; by default,
	anti-aliasing is enabled.
	If anti-aliasing is enable, then the <bf/x11alpha/
	device is used and Ghostscript will be run with the <em/-dNOPLATFONTS/
	switch; if anti-aliasing is disabled, then the <bf/x11/ device
	will be used.
	This switch sets the <ref name="antialias" id="appres-antialias">
	resource for Ghostview widgets.
<p><tag/-arguments args/
	Specify additional arguments for Ghostscript; this switch sets the
	<ref name="arguments" id="appres-arguments"> resource.
<p><tag/-color, -grayscale, -greyscale, -monochrome/
	Force color/grayscale/monochrome display; these switches do not
	have anything to do with the visual, depth, or colormap that
	&mgv; uses, you will want to use the <em/-visual/, <em/-visualid/,
	<em/-depth/, and <em/-privatecm/ switches for that.
	These switches set the <bf/palette/ resource.
<p><tag/-dpi n, -resolution n/
	Specify the overall resolution; these switches set the <bf/Resolution/
	resource.
<p><tag/-gslocale locale/
	Force the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ window property to be written according
	to <em/locale/.
	This switch sets the <ref name="gsLocale" id="appres-gsLocale">
	resource.
<p><tag/-interpreter interp/
	Use <bf/interp/ as the &ps; interpreter.  This switch is useful
	if you want to use an interpreter that is not in your PATH or
	is not the first <bf/gs/ is your PATH.
	This switch sets the <ref name="interpreter" id="appres-interpreter">

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Caveats and Bugs<label id="caveats"><p>
<sect1>Switches Pages Too Fast<p>
I have had bug reports about crashes when you change pages too fast.  I
have been able to reproduce the problem but I had to hold the <em/PageDown/
key down to trigger the bug.  I think I know what's going on but I'm still
thinking about the best way to fix the problem.  Since the bug only manifests
itself under extreme circumstances and since I've only had one bug report
about this, I'm not going to try and rush a fix out.  In the mean time,
you can avoid the problem by not holding the <em/PageDown/ or <em/PageUp/
keys down, use the page list instead.  My apologies if this causes anyone
grief.

<sect1>Modal Dialogs<p>
&mgv; has no modal dialogs (even the <em/overwrite confirmation/ dialog
in <em>File/Save...</em> is modeless); modal dialogs are evil.  This really
means that dialogs don't stop you from doing other things in the application:
you don't have to back out of a dialog to change something and bring the
dialog back--you just go and change things without leaving your current
dialog.
For people that have lived too long under the tyranny of modal dialogs
this may be confusing.

<sect1>Anti-aliasing<label id="caveats-antialias"><p>
The anti-aliasing support in newer versions of Ghostscript (version 3.33 GNU and
higher) is a mixed blessing.
For text documents, especially those produced by <bf/dvips/ from TeX DVI
documents, the readability advantages are wonderful and easily overshadow
the performance penalties (which aren't that noticeable with text anyway);
however, anti-aliasing delivers a noticeable performance penalty on graphics
and can actually make the images look worse, anti-aliasing can also seriously
degrade any document which uses a lot of colors when viewed on an eight-bit
display.
If you find this happening to you, try using the <bf/antialiasEPS/ resource
(or the <em/-aliaseps/ and <em/-noaliaseps/ switches) to change the 
anti-aliasing of EPS files.

<sect1>Non-DSC and PDF Documents<p>
If the document does not begin with <tt/&percnt;!PS-Adobe-/, it does not
claim conformance to the document structuring convention; the functionality
of &mgv; is severely limited when dealing with non-DSC conformant
documents--about all you can do is move to the next page.
Also, zooming in a non-DSC document will always display the first page.
Since I haven't implemented a PDF parser, PDF files are effectively
treated as non-DSC documents so that &mgv; is quite limited when viewing
PDF files (xpdf or Adobe's Acroread are much better for PDF files).

<sect1>Broken Windows PostScript Drivers<p>
Some &ps; documents produced by the MS-Windows &ps; drivers will cause
erroneous warnings about a lack of virtual memory.
When trying to view such documents, you will only get a page telling you
that you don't have enough memory in your printer and some steps (which will
probably be useless if you don't have the original document) to correct the
problem.
A simple hack to fix this problem is to find a line that looks like
<verb>
	30000 VM?
</verb>
and remove it.
The following perl filter should fix such documents:
<verb>
	perl -pe 's/^(\d+\s+VM\?\r?)$/% \1/'
</verb>
Thanks to Bart Robinson (<tt/lomew@cs.utah.edu/) in comp.lang.postscript
for this advice.

Windows printer drivers for &ps; also tend to produce incorrect DSC comments.
The Windows PostScript driver builds the <bf/NTPSOct94/ dictionary which
contains various functions; the required <tt/NTPSOct94 begin/ command appears
between the <tt/&percnt;&percnt;EndSetup/ comment and the first
<tt/&percnt;&percnt;Page/ comment so that neither &mgv; or Ghostview will pass
<tt/NTPSOct94 begin/ to Ghostscript.  The simplest solution is to change
<verb>
	%%EndSetup
	NTPSOct94 begin
	%%Page: 1 1
</verb>
to
<verb>
	NTPSOct94 begin
	%%EndSetup
	%%Page: 1 1
</verb>
in the offending document (this is will leave your &ps; file <em/less/
broken rather than fixed).
A better solution--which the NT &ps; driver should probably be
doing--is to remove the offending &dquot;<tt/NTPSOct94 begin/&dquot;
command and add &dquot;<tt/NTPSOct94 begin/&dquot; at the beginning of
each page and add an &dquot;<tt/end/&dquot; at the end of each page.
The following perl script should perform this transformation on its standard
input and print the fixed file to its standard output:
<verb>
	#!/usr/local/bin/perl
	$first_page = 1;
	$bogus      = "";
	while($line = <STDIN>) {
		##
		## Skip NT's brain damage (at least a little teeny tiny
		## part of it)
		##
		if($line =~ /^NTPSOct9[45] begin/) {
			$bogus = $line;
			next;
		}

		##
		## Insert appropriate begin/end pairs
		##
		if($first_page && $line =~ /%%Page:/) {
			print $line, $bogus;
			$first_page = 0;
		}
		elsif($line =~ /%%Page:/) {
			print "end\n", $line, $bogus;
		}
		elsif($line =~ /%%Trailer/) {
			print "end\n$line";
			# next line is the "end" that we want to kill
			$line = <STDIN>;
		}
		else {
			print $line;
		}
	}
	exit(0);
</verb>
The same problem occurs with the <bf/NTPSOct95/ version of the &ps; driver
but the above script should deal with that one too.

<sect1>DSC Parsing Problems<p>
The current DSC parser doesn't like Mac files (which use a single carriage
return as end-of-line); if you want to view such files, change the
carriage returns to line feeds with something like this:
<verb>
	perl -pe 's/\r/\n/g' < mac-file > unix-file
</verb>
and try again.  I could attempt to fix the DSC parser but I'd rather not
touch it until I have time to build a cleaner one.

Files with a PageOrder of <bf/Special/ will confuse the DSC parser--pages
will be lost or out of order.  If you have to deal with such files, you'll
have to use another viewer until I can rewrite the DSC parser.

<sect1>Application Defaults Version Problems<p>
The application defaults file specifies a significant portion of &mgv;'s
behavior; hence, an incorrect application defaults file can cause many
problems.  If &mgv; warns you about an incorrect version number, you
should fix it--setting the <ref name="applicationVersion"
id="appres-applicationVersion"> will not fix the problem, it will only
make the warning go away.

The correct version of the application defaults file should be installed
in the same place as the documentation (look for a file called <tt>MGv</tt>)
so you can fix the problem by running &mgv; like this:
<verb>
	XENVIRONMENT=/path/to/mgv/library/files/MGv mgv
</verb>
until the local administrator can fix the problem by removing the old
application defaults file.  This problem should only be encountered by
people that started with &mgv; version 1.x.

<sect1>Non-Default Visuals on Irix 5.3<p>
I have had reports of problems with non-default visuals under Irix 5.3
when the root window has depth eight.  Everything works fine with Irix 6.2/6.4
and other systems.  Private colormaps do work with Irix 5.3 so all is not
lost.  As near as I can tell, this is a bug somewhere in SGI's Motif libraries
and I don't know how to work around the problem.

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>Reporting Bugs<p>
If you find any bugs in &mgv; please send a bug report to &EMAIL;
which includes the following information:
<itemize>
<item>&mgv; version number
<item>operating system name and release number
<item>Motif and X versions
<item>Ghostscript version
<item>clear and concise instructions to reproduce the bug (include sample
	&ps; files if possible)
<item>anything else that may be relevant
</itemize>
The information in the build options dialog
(see <ref id="help-bldopts" name="Build Options Dialog">) may be useful
as well.  If you can fix the bug, a patch would be appreciated but please
bear in mind that the author is somewhat fanatical about maintaining a
consistent coding/naming style in the code so patches may be reformatted
and/or torn apart before they get into the code.

I will try and respond to all bug reports quickly (where <em/quickly/ is a
function of how detailed the report is and how easy it is for me to
reproduce) but don't be surprised if it takes me a few days to respond.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Mathoms<p>
This section is a dumping ground for things that don't belong anywhere else
(<em/mathom/ is a Hobbit term:  a mathom is something that no one knows
what to do with but they don't want to throw it away).

<sect1>Enlightening mgv<p>
If you're into the
<url url="http://www.enlightenment.org" name="enlightened"> look, then you
should make sure you don't try and specify a <bf/backgroundPixmap/ for the
main scrolled window.  Resource settings like this:
<verb>
	MGv*view*backgroundPixmap:        XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP
	MGv*backgroundPixmap:             /full/path/to/tile.xpm
	MGv*foreground:                   fg
	MGv*background:                   bg
	MGv*XmText.backgroundPixmap:      XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP
	MGv*XmTextField.backgroundPixmap: XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP
	MGv*XmList.backgroundPixmap:      XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP
</verb>
should give you the enlightened look (text and list widgets look pretty
crappy with background pixmaps so there's no point in even trying).
If you try and specify a
<bf/backgroundPixmap/ for <bf/view/, you will probably get an X protocol
error at startup.  For best results, <bf/fg/ should contrast with the whole
tiling pixmap (smooth pixmaps work best) and <bf/bg/ should be a solid color
that is close the pixmap colors.  Better results can be had if you're willing
to set up different pixmaps for the various types of widgets; if you come
up with anything really cool, let me know.  If you're wondering what this
stuff looks like, my &HOMEPAGE; has a couple of screen shots.

If you don't have Motif 2.0.1+ then the <bf/backgroundPixmap/ resource might
not work (it does work with Netscape 4.X/Linux and that uses Motif 1.2.X).
I have tried this stuff with Irix and CDE (Motif 1.2.5) without success:
&mgv; died on Irix and ignored the pixmap under CDE.  I think the problem
could be fixed by adding a String to Pixmap type converter that understood
XPM files but that will have to wait.  Most LessTif libraries supply a
String to Pixmap type converter that understands XPM files so LessTif users
should be able use fancy tiling as well.

<sect1>Using mgv With Netscape<p>
If you want to use &mgv; as the &ps; viewer with Netscape you just have
to set the <bf>application/postscript</bf> MIME handler to
&dquot;mgv &percnt;s&dquot;.  The MIME handlers can be configured in
the big <em/Preferences/ dialog for Netscape 4 or in the <em/Helpers/
tab of the <em/General Preferences/ dialog in Netscape 3.

This is the original reason that I changed the saving behavior of &mgv;:
in version one you could only save marked pages, now you can save whatever
you want.

<sect1>Using mgv With CDE<p>
If you want to use &mgv; in the CDE desktop, the following article from
comp.unix.cde may be of interest:

Here's an example for the postscript file type that will use ghostscript
and ghostview to print/view postscript files.

This would probably work with &mgv; if you change &dquot;ghostview&dquot;
to &dquot;mgv&dquot; all over the place.  You'll have to make your own icons
though (<tt>lib/icon.xpm</tt> would be a good starting place but it
is the wrong size).  I can't really help you with this so you're on
your own (of course, I'd be interested in any results).

<sect1>Splash Screen<p>
Here's the &ps; program from the splash screen for the curious:

<sect1>Binaries<p>
I stopped making Linux binaries because LessTif is good enough for &mgv;
these days.

Binaries for HP-UX are available from the
<url url="http://hpux.cae.wisc.edu" name="HP-UX Porting and Archive Center">
(okay, I admit, I submitted the request for this).

Binaries for FreeBSD are available from the porting section of the
<url url="http://www.freebsd.org" name="FreeBSD Homepage"> (I didn't
submit the request for this, someone else did).

If anyone knows where people can get binaries for other platforms, RPM
packages, or Debian packages, please let me know so that I can add links
to the &mgv; web page.

<sect>Availability<p>
The latest release of &mgv; will be available at my &HOMEPAGE; (any beta
versions will be here as well).
New releases will be announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

The latest release of Ghostscript is available from
<url url="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu" name="the GNU home site">
and
<url url="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin" name="the GhostScript archives">.

<sect>Acknowledgements<p>
&mgv; is based on Ghostview by Tim Theisen (<tt/tim@cs.wisc.edu/) with some
ideas from Ghostview-VMS by Johannes Plass
(<tt/plass@dipmza.physik.uni-mainz.de/).
I'd also like to thank L. Peter Deutsch, president of Aladdin Enterprises,
(<tt/ghost@aladdin.com/) for Ghostscript (without which, &mgv; would not be possible).

None of this would be possible without Linux and the FSF.
I currently develop &mgv; using LessTif.

The conversion to GNU autoconf probably would have been much harder
if I couldn't borrow code and ideas from the <url name="DDD"

<sect>Installing and Porting<label id="installation"><p>
GNU autoconf is used to handle the configuration, compilation, and
installation of &mgv; so the standard
<verb>
	./configure
	make
	make install
</verb>
should work.

<p>The <tt/configure/ script will disable debug information and enable
optimization by default but this can be changed with the following switches:
<descrip>
<tag/--enable-debug, --disable-debug/
	Enable or disable debugging, debugging is disabled by default.
	The default debug switch it <em/-g/ but you can change it by
	setting the <bf/DEBUGFLAG/ environment variable before running
	<tt/configure/.
<p><tag/--enable-optimize, --disable-optimize/
	Enable or disable optimization, optimization is enabled by default.
	The default optimization switch is <em/-O2/ but you can change it
	by setting the <bf/OPTFLAG/ environment variable before running
	<tt/configure/.
</descrip>
If optimization is requested but debugging is not requested, the final
executable will be stripped by passing the <em/-s/ switch to the linker,
if you need to use a different stripping switch, set the <bf/STRIPFLAG/
environment variable before running <tt/configure/.

<p>If the <tt/configure/ script is having trouble finding X on your
system then you may have to specify the header and library paths explicitly
with one or more of the following switches:
<descrip>
<tag>--x-includes=<em/DIR/, --x-libraries=<em/DIR/</tag>
	Specify the location of the X11 headers and libraries.
<p><tag>--motif-includes=<em/DIR/, --motif-libraries=<em/DIR/</tag>
	Specify the location of the Motif headers and libraries.
<p><tag>--xpm-includes=<em/DIR/, --xpm-libraries=<em/DIR/</tag>
	Specify the location of the XPM headers and libraries.  If you don't
	want to use XPM even though you have it, you can disable XPM with
	<em/--without-xpm/.
</descrip>

I assume ANSI and POSIX support, if your system doesn't have an ANSI
C compiler and POSIX libraries then you're out of luck.  I'm not willing
to give up this assumption, trying to support non-POSIX systems is more
trouble than I care to think about.

If you have installed any of the 1.x versions of &mgv; you should delete
the old application defaults file (probably
<tt>/usr/X11/lib/app-defaults/MGv</tt> or something similar) before running
&mgv;; if you don't, &mgv; will warn you about it and the user interface
will be really screwed up.  If you have just compiled a new version of
&mgv; and you haven't installed it yet, you can set the <bf/XENVIRONMENT/
environment variable to temporarily fix the version problem:
<verb>
	XENVIRONMENT=MGv ./mgv
</verb>
However, you really should delete the old application defaults file anyway:
none of the &mgv; versions need it, the whole application defaults file has
always been compiled in as default resources.

I have had success reports on the following systems:
<itemize>
<item>RedHat 5.1 Linux with LessTif 0.86
<item>Linux/libc5 with Mootif
<item>Sun Solaris 2.6 with gcc
<item>FreeBSD 2.2.7-STABLE
<item>HP-UX 9.05 with gcc
<item>SGI Irix 6.2
</itemize>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>History<p>
<sect1>mgv 3.1.5: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed the <em/mark even/ and <em/mark odd/ toolbar buttons.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.1.4: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed an auto sizing bug.  Telling &mgv; to automatically resize both
	the width and height of the main window could cause X protocol errors
	and/or bizarre window sizes (okay, I admit it, I'm just trying to
	get a version number closer to <bf/pi/:  I have TeX-envy).
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.1.3: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added a simple work-around for a LessTif accelerator problem.
	Menu accelerators were going away as soon as you brought up a dialog
	box.  This little work-around isn't needed unless you're using
	LessTif.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.1.2: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Netscape HTML help got broken in 3.1.0, I converted some fixed sized
	buffers to dynamically sized buffers and neglected to remove some
	<tt/memset/ calls.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.1.1: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed a memory corruption bug, thanks to &StephenVeit; for reporting
	the bug and a fix for it.
<item>Fixed up the XPM include logic.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.1.0: September 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Finally added a tool bar, you can change the images used but there
	is currently no way to change the entries without hacking the
	source.
<item>Switched to autoconf for configuration and compiling and there was
	much rejoicing.  The autoconf/automake files for DDD and LessTif
	were invaluable.  This change means that library files (help files,
	icons, splash screens, etc...) will usually end up in
	<tt>/usr/local/share</tt> because autoconf likes it that way; the
	new library directory will contain a subdirectory for each &mgv;
	version installed.
<item>Removed the <em/LessTif Problems/ section of the manual, I don't know
	of any problems anymore.
<item>Added some simple hooks for <tt/malloc/ debugging via dmalloc
	(<tt>ftp://ftp.letters.com/src/dmalloc/dmalloc.tar.gz</tt>).
	If for some reason you want to enable dmalloc, make sure you
	configure dmalloc to allow freeing <tt/NULL/ pointers:  ANSI
	guarantees that <tt/free(0)/ will work and I assume ANSI all
	over the place.
<item>Removed all instance of <bf/popen/(3) from the source, this function
	has a history of compile problems so it went away.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.0.2: August 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed an install problem in the lib directory, the makefile had an
	incorrect source path.  Seems that my QA is lacking in some areas.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.0.1: August 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added the version number to the library directory.  Thanks to
	&MartyLeisner; for the suggestion.
<item>Fixed up a couple of compiler warnings.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 3.0.0: August 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added panning as yet another scrolling option in the main viewing
	window.  This lets you drag the viewing window around with mouse
	button two.
<item>Disabled editres support on everything but Linux and FreeBSD.
	Editres and the Xmu library were just causing build problems
	so they went away; I know it works on Linux and FreeBSD (as far
	as I know, XFree86 always comes with a fully functional Xmu) so
	I've left it enabled there.
<item>Fixed a window sizing bug with EPS and non-DSC files; automatic
	window sizing didn't do anything in these cases but now it works
	as expected.  Thanks to &ErikLuijten; for pointing out the
	problem.
<item>Renamed the <em>Window</em> menu to <em>View</em> and moved it over
	the the third entry from the left in the menu bar.
<item>Removed the (deprecated in version 2.1) <bf/printer/ resource,
	the printer name is now officially part of the <bf/printCommand/
	resource.
<item>Updated my sgml-tools to 1.0.6, some minor document hackery was
	needed for this.
<item>Fixed a Lesstif/Motif incompatibility with the file selection
	widget.  I was setting the <bf/dirMask/ resource on file
	selection widgets to get a specific file name filter but Lesstif
	wants me to use <bf/pattern/ instead.  Another reading of the
	Motif documentation has convinced me that <bf/pattern/ is the
	right one anyway.
<item>Dropped support for the (ancient) Mosaic/CCI help support.  If anyone
	actually uses this I'll consider putting it back but I don't think
	it is worth the compile trouble.
<item>Removed a LessTif ifdef in <tt>wlib/create.c</tt>, gadgets seem to
	be working fine now.
<item>Changed the <em/Center/ entry in the <em/Page/ menu to a toggle button;
	page centering now stays around when you change pages.  The
	<em/-center/ and <em/-nocenter/ switches and the <em/center/ resource
	were also added.
<item>Fixed a bad memory free when reporting unknown switches.  I was freeing
	an incremented pointer, how embarrassing.  Thanks to
	&GuenterSteinbach; for reporting this problem.
<item>Added <em/-?/ and <em/-H/ as aliases for <em/-help/.
<item>Added some notes about binary distributions.
</itemize>
I wanted to get a tool bar into this release but some bugs came up and I
wanted to get fixes for them out.  This means that there will probably be
another small release soon with a tool bar.

<sect1>mgv 2.4.3: May 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added <bf/make/, <bf/bindir/, and <bf/libdir/ to the version
	information which appears in the <em/Build Options/ dialog and
	the <em/-version/ output.
<item>Fixed an ambiguous <em/if/ statement in <tt/dsc.c/.  Thanks to
	&MartyLeisner; for the fix.
<item>Moved the <tt/INSTALL/ file to the top directory where it should
	be.  Thanks to &MartyLeisner; for telling me about this
	brain damage.
<item>Two radio buttons in the <em/Magstep/ menu could be turned on
	if you specified a non-default initial magstep.  This problem
	was just cosmetic but a bug is a bug.  Thanks to &ErikLuijten;
	for pointing out this problem.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.4.2: April 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Removed the <bf/SGI/, <bf/CDE/, and <bf/Xnt/ stubs in the help system.
	I never had a chance to implement any of these and I no longer have
	access to an SGI or CDE system so I've removed the stubs.
<item>Removed all traces of Xmu from the Ghostview widget.  Many people
	seem to have old versions of libXmu or they don't have Xmu at all
	so Xmu had to go.
<item>Turned off editres support on AIX by default.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.4.1: April 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>The <tt>wlib/resource.c</tt> file wasn't supposed to exist in 2.4
	but I neglected to delete a CVS tag so it was there.  This caused
	some build problems because <tt>wlib/wlib/wlib.h</tt> didn't have
	the necessary prototypes for <tt>wlib/resource.c</tt>.  I have
	now properly killed <tt>wlib/resource.c</tt>.
<item>Added some missing <bf/null/ checks to some of the resource handling.
	The problem (a segfault) would only show up if &mgv; couldn't find
	one of the standard print commands in your <bf/PATH/ environment
	variable.
<item>&AndrewSmith; informed me that Solaris's cc prefers <em/-xO2/
	instead of the usual <em/-O2/ to get level two optimizations
	so I fixed the &dquot;<tt>make/sys.solaris-cc.mk</tt>&dquot;
	makefile.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.4: March 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added the <bf/wlInstallIcon/ resource to control whether or not &mgv;
	installs its own icon when it runs.  If you want to use a different
	icon, then you can just set this resource to <bf/false/ and tell
	your window manager to use your icon.  Thanks to &HansVahlenkamp;
	for this suggestion.  SGI users can use one of the <tt/mgv.icon*/
	files as their icon if they wish (the images are pretty cheesy,
	if anyone wants to donate a better one, please do).
<item>Made editres support configurable at run-time (via resources and
	switches) or compile-time.  I have had reports that that HP-UX
	10.20 doesn't come with editres support so I added a standard
	work-around.  HP-UX 10.20 users (and others without editres)
	should set <tt/mk-editres/ to <bf/no/ in the appropriate
	<tt>make/sys.*.mk</tt> file before compiling.
<item>One more little makefile hack for FreeBSD.  Thanks to &BrianHandy;
	for the patch.
<item>Added the <em/Back/ and <em/Forward/ entries to the popup menu.
	These additions were based on a suggestion from &ErikLuijten;.
<item>Added the ability to read a &ps; file from the standard input.
	You can save the standard input to a temporary file (this gives you
	full page navigation) or just read it as it comes in.
	Thanks to &DavidGreen; for this suggestion.
<item>Increased the optimization level to <tt/-O2/ on all platforms.
	I don't think this will cause any problems.
<item>Finally fixed the <em/current page not visible in the page list/
	bug.  You used to be able to move the selected item in the page
	list out of the visible range (i.e. if you're page list had room
	for ten items and you moved to page eleven with PageDown, the
	eleven in the page list wouldn't be visible).
<item>Added support for compressing, gzipping, and bzip2ing saved files.
	This was a quick and simple addition so I added it even though it
	has dubious utility.
<item>Merged the <em>Mark&verbar;Mark Current Page</em> and
	<em>Mark&verbar;Unmark Current Page</em> menu items.  The new
	entry (<em>Mark&verbar;Mark/Unmark</em>) toggles the state of the
	current page.
<item>Changed the behavior of the <em>Mark&verbar;Mark Even Pages</em> and
	<em>Mark&verbar;Mark Odd Pages</em> menu items so that they no
	longer unmark any pages.  <em>Mark Even</em> used to mark the
	even pages and unmark the odd pages, now it just marks the even
	pages and leaves the odd pages alone.  Similarly, the
	<em>Mark Odd</em> command no longer unmarks the even pages.
<item>Some minor hacks for RedHat 5.0 systems.  There are still some
	outstanding linking problems (no surprises here) with commercial
	Motif libraries; LessTif should work though.
<item>Added &dquot;<tt/-W/&dquot; to the compiler warning flags for all
	gcc setups.  This gives even more warnings the &dquot;<tt/-Wall
	-Werror -ansi -pedantic -Wmissing-prototypes/&dquot and this
	is good.
<item>Disabled gadgets when compiling with LessTif.  I only use gadgets
	to allow people to use funky background pixmaps with Motif 2.0+
	so disabling gadgets really doesn't hurt anything (disabling
	gadgets was a simple, clean, isolated hack to <tt>wlib/create.c</tt>
	so it doesn't hurt me either).
<item>Updated the <em/LessTif Problems/ section again.
<item>Fixed the error message when you try to open a non-existent file;
	&mgv; was using <tt/EPERM/ instead of <tt/errno/ so the message
	wasn't always accurate.
<item>Loosened up the DSC checks.  As long as the &ps; document begins with
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;!/&dquot; we'll scan for the structure comments.
	DSC documents are supposed to start with
	&dquot;<tt/&percnt;!PS-Adobe-/&dquot; and a version number but
	there are some naughty &ps; files out there.
<item>Fixed a couple of typos in <tt>wlib/wlib/dirtysocks.h</tt> that
	were causing problems on Sun machines with Sun's compiler.
	Thanks go to &JeanJacquesMoulis; for letting me know about
	the problem.
<item>Added a warning message about unknown switches.  &mgv; used to
	try to open unknown switches as &ps; files but now it ignores
	such things.  As a side effect you'll have to do one of the standard
	Unix tricks (end the switches with &dquot;<tt/--/&dquot; or use
	&dquot;<tt>./-blah</tt>&dquot;) to open files which begin with
	a hyphen from the command line.
	Thanks to &DavidGreen; for this suggestion.
<item>I've changed ISPs once again so all references to <tt/echo-on.net/
	have been converted to the new and improved <tt/trends.net/.
<item>Added the <em/Document Info/ dialog.
<item>Added the splash screen.  If you don't like my artwork, you're free
	to use your own by replacing the <tt/splash.xpm/ and/or
	<tt/splash.xbm/ files in the final library directory.  If you
	don't like splash screens at all, use the <bf/-nosplash/ switch
	or set the &dquot;mgv*wlShowSplashScreen&dquot; resource
	to <bf/False/.
<item>Added support for <em/sticky/ dialogs.  Some people don't like it
	when dialogs popdown just because you've hit <em/OK/ (or equivalent).
	See the <bf/autoDismiss/ resource and the <em/Sticky Dialogs/ section
	for more information.  This only affects the <em/File Save/,
	<em/Print/, and <em/Set Magstep/ dialogs.  This functionality
	is based on a suggestion from &CarlBenker;.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.3.1: February 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Modified the makefiles to know about and use <tt/ranlib/ if necessary.
	As far as I know, only FreeBSD (version 2.X at least) needs
	<tt/ranlib/.  This change also has the bonus side effect of allowing
	&dquot;<tt/make -j/&dquot; to be used in the <tt/wlib/ directory
	(this may not matter to you but it is a big win on my K6-200);
	the only disadvantage is a slight increase in disk space when you're
	compiling.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.3: February 1998<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added a work-around for a bug in Motif 1.2.3.  If you moved one of the
	main scrollbars out of the default position and left it out of the
	default position, a File|Close would cause a segmentation fault
	deep inside Motif.  The problem was that &mgv; was trying to move the
	scrollbars in a widget that was in the process of dying, newer versions
	of Motif don't mind this but 1.2.3 was missing a check for this state.
	Some versions of Motif 1.2.5 also appear to have this problem.
<item>Updated the <em/LessTif Problems/ section;
	&mgv; and LessTif; almost get along perfectly now.
<item>Added the <bf/gunzip/ and <bf/bunzip/ resources.  These resources
	replace the <bf/decompress/ resource but <bf/decompress/ remains
	as an alias for <bf/gunzip/.  These changes were made so that &mgv;
	could deal with bzip2ed files, bzip2 is much slower than gzip but
	offers better compression on many files.  You can get bzip2 from
	the <url url="http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk" name="bzip2 homepage">
	or the <url url="http://www.digistar.com/bzip2/index.html"
	name="bzip2 US mirror">; you can also get bzip2 anywhere that you
	can get <url url="http://www.gimp.org" name="the Gimp">.
<item>The <bf/resetScrollBars/ resource has been expanded to offer control
	over the horizontal and vertical scrollbars separately; this just
	means that you can have only the vertical scrollbar reset on page
	changes if you want.  The old boolean values, <bf/true/ and <bf/false/,
	have been retained as aliases.  Thanks to &DmitriKulginov; for
	this feature.
<item>Page list updates (during <em/Mark All/ and <em/Show Page Labels/ for
	example) should be much faster now.
<item>Added <tt/-D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED/ to the compiler flags for AIX.
	I hear that AIX 4.3 needs this rather than <tt/-D_XOPEN_SOURCE/
	so I'll try it out with both defined and hope for the best (will
	the madness of <tt/-D_POSIX_SOURCE/, <tt/-D_XOPEN_SOURCE/,
	<tt/-D_BSD_SOURCE/, etc... ever end?).  Thanks to
	&LukaszDutkiewicz; for telling me about this new piece of
	vendor/standards brilliance.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.2.1: December 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>Fixed a buffer overflow problem in the printing.  The bug was a really
	dumb mistake, sorry for the brain damage.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.2: November 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>Added support for non-default color depths, non-default visuals, and
	private color maps.  This didn't have that much impact on the
	application but it is a cool enough increase in functionality to
	warrant an increase in the minor version number rather than just
	the patch level.  Thanks to &HansVahlenkamp; for hassling me
	about this lacking feature (okay, <em/hassling/ is probably a little
	strong).
<item>Fixed a bug in zoom window destruction.  If you zoomed on a zoom and
	killed the first zoom before the zoomed zoom, you used to get death
	but now you don't.
<item>Fixed the menu accelerators to avoid duplication; the following
	accelerators were changed:
	<itemize>
	<item>The <em/Magstep/ menu is now activated with <bf/Alt+T/ instead
		of <bf/Alt+G/.
	<item>The <em/Options/ menu is now activated with <bf/Alt+S/ instead
		of <bf/Alt+O/ (this was taken).
	<item>The <em/Set/ entry in the <em/Magstep/ menu no longer has
		an accelerator, I couldn't think of anything sensible
		that wasn't already taken by something that gets more use.
	<item>The <em/Enable Smooth Scrolling/ entry in the <em/Options/
		menu is now activated with <bf/Alt+L/ instead of the old
		<bf/Alt+O/.
	</itemize>
	If anyone doesn't like this, you can change them through the
	resource database to whatever you want.
<item>Fixed up the code that deals with (depth one) bitmaps for icons.  The
	old code was causing a BadMatch error on some systems because a copy
	was attempted from a depth one Pixmap to a Window with a different
	depth.
<item>Added the <bf/wlUseColorIcon/ resource so you can tell &mgv; to use or
	not use a color icon at run-time.
<item>Fixed the spelling of Matthew's name in various places (I thought
	there was only one &dquot;t&dquot;).
<item>Added a couple of minor (and harmless) changes to the resources for
	LessTif.  These changes don't affect Motif versions of &mgv;.
<item>Added some notes on the Ghostview widget resources to the
	<em/Application Resources/ section of the manual.  I was sure
	the resources were already listed but I was wrong.
<item>Added the <em/-portrait/, <em/-landscape/, <em/-seascape/, and
	<em/-upsidedown/ switches to control the initial page orientation.
<item>Extended the FreeBSD 2.2.2 support to deal with FreeBSD 3 with
	Motif 1.2.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.1: October 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>Reversed the order of History list.
<item>Removed the <em/Printer Name/ text field from the print dialog.  The
	print command now holds both the command to use and the printer name.
	The resources (<bf/printer/ and <bf/printCommand/ are still separate,
	you can forget about <bf/printer/ and put it all in <bf/printCommand/
	if you want).
<item>Fixed the <em/GhostviewSendPS/ prototype.
	The old prototype had a <tt>long</tt> where it should have had
	an <tt>off_t</tt>.  Apparently HP-UX 10.20's <tt>off_t</tt> isn't a
	<tt>long</tt> like it is on all the other machines (otherwise the
	compilers would have complained long ago).  This was reported and
	fixed by &KarlStorck;.
<item>Small fixes to the makefiles and dirtysocks.h for Solaris 2.6/Intel.
	Thanks to &ThanhMa; for the patch.
<item>I've changed ISPs once again (I'm on my third one this year), lglobal.com
	just got swallowed by echo-on.net so I've updated everything for this.
	I think it is time I forked out the cash for a virtual host somewhere.
<item>Some minor hacks were added to allow &mgv; and LessTif to get along
	a little better.  There are still a number of problems with using
	LessTif but most things work.  I've only tested
	things with the lesstif-current from 1997-10-02 so the current
	release might still be broken.  You might also want to check
	my &HOMEPAGE; for any updates on &mgv; and LessTif.
<item>
	A preliminary port to FreeBSD 2.2.2 was supplied by
	&ChristopherYoder;.  The initial attempt was done with LessTif 
	so I don't know how well this works yet (I don't expect any
	problems).
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.0.2: August 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>
	Always scroll the scrolled window back to the top when closing
	a file.  Sometimes the scrolled window would get confused about
	where its child was when opening a new file; this only appears
	to happen if you are scrolled down near the bottom and then you
	open a new file in the same window.  The confusion only happens
	with some files (the exact conditions are unknown but this
	scrolling-back-to-the-top trick makes the problem go away).
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.0.1: August 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>
	Fixed an auto-sizing bug.  Any auto-sizing will now take effect
	if you hide the page list, menubar, or status line.
<item>
	Trying to open a non-existent file from the command line will
	now produce a warning message.  Doing
	&dquot;<tt>mgv not-there.ps</tt>&dquot; used to just give an
	empty window.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 2.0: August 1997<p>
<itemize>
<item>
	Help system extended to deal with Netscape's remote protocol
	and Mosaic's CCI protocol.
	CDE help, and SGI help are still coming.
	The <bf/helpSuffix/ resource has been replaced with <bf/helpType/.
<item>
	Added palette changing menu items.
<item>
	Changed the float resources in the Ghostview widget to integers to
	avoid alignment problems on the DEC Alpha (unaligned access).
<item>
	Freeing unallocated memory bugs in Ghostview.c fixed (some resources
	were getting copied by SetValues() and freed by Destroy() but not
	copied by Initialize()).  These bugs were caused by some modifications
	that I made to the Ghostview widget.  All of the String resources for
	the Ghostview widget are now copied as God intended them to be.
<item>
	You can now save a document without marking pages.
<item>
	Fixed two orientation bugs so that you no longer get forced back to
	the first page when changing orientation and changing the orientation
	from the menus will always work (in some cases, mgv would switch to
	the orientation in the document when you tried to change orientations).
<item>
	Added a ghost to the icon (hey, this is reason enough to upgrade
	isn't it?).
<item>
	Added the <bf/mgvMark/ action to the page list to make marking pages
	easier (maybe).
<item>
	Cleaned up the keyboard handling in the main viewing window so
	that the cursor keys do the <em/right thing/; the new <bf/mgvScroll/
	action was added to facilitate this.
<item>
	Support for multiple top level windows added.
<item>
	On-the-fly decompression of compressed files added.
<item>
	All dialogs now make use of the <bf/defaultButton/ and
	<bf/cancelButton/ resources for better compliance with the Motif
	Style Guide.  The zooming is now attached to mouse button one
	(used to be button two but Motif wants button two for drag-and-drop
	operations).  If you want the old bindings back you just have to
	change the <bf/baseTranslations/ for the Ghostview widget to:
	<verb>
	MGv*Ghostview.baseTranslations:	#replace         \n\
		<Key>osfHelp:	wlHelpContext()          \n\
		<Message>:	gvMessage()              \n\
		!<Btn2Down>:	mgvZoom(begin)           \n\
		!<Btn2Motion>:	mgvZoom(extend)          \n\
		!<Btn2Up>:	mgvZoom(end)             \n\
		!<Btn1Down>:	mgvZoom(begin)           \n\
		!<Btn1Motion>:	mgvZoom(extend)          \n\
		!<Btn1Up>:	mgvZoom(end)             \n\
		<EnterWindow>:	gvNotify(0)              \n\
		<LeaveWindow>:	gvNotify(0)              \n\
		<MotionNotify>:	gvNotify(0)              \n\
		<Key>osfUp:	mgvScroll(up,	magical) \n\
		<Key>osfDown:	mgvScroll(down,	magical) \n\
		<Key>osfLeft:	mgvScroll(left)          \n\
		<Key>osfRight:	mgvScroll(right)
	</verb>
	These bindings will give you zooming with either button one
	or button two.
<item>
	Added the <em/magic/ scrolling based on a suggestion and patch
	from &BrianDowling;. This introduced the <bf/magicScrolling/ and
	<bf/magicResistance/ resources.
<item>
	Modified the magstep menu based on a suggestion and patch from
	&BrianDowling;.  The old magstep menu let you choose from -5
	through +5, the new one lets you increase and decrease it as desired.
<item>
	Added the <em/Auto Size/, <em/Auto Height/, and <em/Auto Width/
	buttons to the <em/Page/ menu; the <bf/autoHeight/ and <bf/autoWidth/
	application resources were also added. Thanks go to &BrianDowling;
	for suggesting this.
<item>
	Added MP-RAS support to the makefiles.
<item>
	Added some screen shots to the documentation.
<item>
	The <em/Reopen/ command will now try and reset the page number.
<item>
	Added support for libhelp online help (see
	<url url="http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ipvr/bv/personen/mache/libhelp"
	name="http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ipvr/bv/personen/mache/libhelp">
	for the libhelp sources).
<item>
	Added smooth scrolling options.
<item>
	Added the <bf/magstep/ resource and the <bf/-magstep/ switch to
	make setting the initial magstep easier. &AndyPolyakov; pointed out
	this feature that got lost between Ghostview and &mgv;.
<item>
	Put the quick access -5 through +5 magstep entries back on the
	<em/Magstep/ menu (a user thought all the clicking and typing
	and screen re-drawing was inconvenient and since I agreed, I put
	the radio buttons back).  &ErikLuijten; liked the old -5 through
	+5 options so they came back.
<item>
	Made explicit page orientations persist through reopens.  Credit
	for this behavior belongs to &ErikLuijten;.
<item>
	Hacked the new auto sizing stuff to, optionally, stay within
	the screen dimensions.  I think mwm does this for us but mwm
	is an evil window manager (if you like mwm, go ahead and disagree
	with me, or kill me, or not).  Since there is no sane way to
	determine how large the window manager decorations are, the
	<bf/wmWidth/ and <bf/wmHeight/ resources were added so you can
	tell &mgv; how big they are (you may notice that Ghostview uses pretty
	much the same hack).  Added the <em/-smartsizing/, <em/-wmwidth/,
	and <em/-wmheight/ switches to control these settings from the
	command line.  I also added the <em/Enable Smart Sizing/ button
	to the <em/Options/ menu.  This stuff was based on a suggestion
	from &AndyPolyakov;.
<item>
	Added the <bf/applicationVersion/ resource to help detect app-defaults
	files with the wrong version.  I also expanded the installation
	documentation to cover this situation.  This stuff was added based
	on problems experienced by &ErikLuijten;. After adding this, I
	moved it to wlib since it was too useful to duplicate in my other
	(as yet unpublished) projects.
<item>
	The <em/Close All Zooms/ entry in the <em/Window/ menu is now
	only sensitive if there are zoom windows.
<item>
	Change the default dirMask of the file-open dialog to <tt/*.*ps*/
	(it was <tt/*.ps/ and then <tt/*.ps*/ to get gzipped/compressed
	files) to try and pick up <tt/.eps/ files too.
<item>
	Converted the menu bar widget tree to the standard (and highly
	idiotic, nonsensical, brain damaged, ...) Motif way.  This
	allows &mgv; to work better with Motif 2.0.0 and perhaps some
	other old versions of Motif (Motif 1.2.2 on AIX 3.2.5 is one of
	them).
<item>
	Keyboard scrolling (the mgvScroll() action) cleaned up.  I added
	the <bf/scrollPercentage/ resource to let users decide how much
	of the screen should be scrolled (the default of <bf/90&percnt;/
	yields a little bit of overlap for context).  This little change
	should make scrolling (including the smooth kind) nicer.
<item>
	Fixed Mosaic-cci help.  This got broken sometime (I don't
	know when since I almost never use this).  The CCI stuff was
	trying to get a hostname out of
	&dquot;<tt>file:///path/to/x/blah.html</tt>&dquot; without
	realizing that <tt>file://</tt> means localhost.
<item>
	Lots of internal changes that shouldn't be visible to the user.
</itemize>

<sect1>mgv 1.0: September 1996<p>
<itemize>
<item>
	First release.
</itemize>

<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>Wish List<p>
This is an unordered list of things that I'm thinking about doing with &mgv;.
<itemize>
<item>
	Resizing a zoom window should expand the zoomed area rather than
	stretching it; effectively, this would allow you to alter the
	zoom reticule after the zoom has popped up.
	The <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ window property
	(see <ref name="The GHOSTVIEW Property" id="gv-win-prop">) has
	four optional values that may be of assistance here.
<item>
	The wlib library needs a simple resource persistence interface.
	This should be pretty easy once I have <em/whatever/ to String
	type converters for the various resources.  Any hacking towards
	this end might also yield a reasonable way to build <em/Options/
	dialogs for modifying the application resources.
<item>
	The <bf/mgvScroll/ action should have a percentage argument (with
	the <bf/scrollPercentage/ resource as a default).
</itemize>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect>The Interface to Ghostscript<label id="gs-interface"><p>
<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>The GHOSTVIEW Environment Variable<p>
When the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ environment variable is set, ghostscript draws on
an existing drawable rather than creating its own window; ghostscript
will draw in either a window or a pixmap depending on the contents
of this variable.

The general form of the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ variable is
<verb>
	window-id [pixmap-id]
</verb>
where <bf/window-id/ is the identifier of the destination window
(<tt/XtWindow(ghostview_widget)/ for example) and the optional
<bf/pixmap-id/ value is the identifier for a pixmap to draw into; both values
are of type <bf/XID/ (32-bit unsigned integer).
If only a window is specified, ghostscript will draw into that window but
if the pixmap is also specified, all drawing will be done on the pixmap.
In both cases the window is used to determine the colormap, screen, and
visual to use; if the destination is a window, then the height and width will
be retrieved from the window, otherwise, the dimensions will be those of the
pixmap.
All remaining information is retrieved from the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ property on the
window (when drawing is done to a pixmap, this property is deleted when read).
Any events that ghostscript wishes to send will be directed at the window
specified in the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ environment variable.


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>The GHOSTVIEW Property<label id="gv-win-prop"><p>
The <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ property is of type <bf/STRING/ and should have the
form
<verb>
	bpixmap orient llx lly urx ury xdpi ydpi [left bottom top right]
</verb>
and a <bf/scanf(3)/ format of
<verb>
	%d %d %d %d %d %d %f %f %d %d %d %d
</verb>
The parameters are:
<descrip>
<tag/bpixmap/
	Pixmap id of the backing pixmap for the window.
	If no pixmap is to be used, this parameter should be zero and this
	parameter must be zero when the destination is a pixmap rather than
	a window.
<p><tag/orient/
	This should be a number representing the page orientation.
	The value is the clockwise rotation of the paper in degrees;
	only 0, 90, 180, and 270 are permitted 
<p><tag/llx, lly, urx, ury/
	The bounding box of the drawable in &ps; points in the default user
	coordinate system.
<p><tag/xdpi, ydpi/
	These values specify the horizontal and vertical resolution of the
	destination.
	Even though these values may be computed from other parameters, they
	are specified to avoid round-off errors.
<p><tag/left, bottom, top, right/
	These optional parameters specify the margins around the window in
	&ps; points; the margins extend the imageable area beyond the
	boundaries of the window.
	This is primarily used for popup zoom windows.
	Some &ps; programs position themselves based on the imageable area
	so these values are useful at times.
	Any unspecified margins are assumed to be zero.
</descrip>


<!--========================================================================-->
<sect1>Events from Ghostscript<p>
If the final destination is a pixmap, the client will get a property notify
event when ghostscript reads the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ property causing it to be
deleted.

Ghostscript sends events to the window where it read the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ property;
these events are of type <bf/ClientMessage/ and the <bf/message_type/ is
set to either <bf/PAGE/ or <bf/DONE/.
The first long data value specifies the window which is to be used when
sending replies to ghostscript; the second long data value specifies the
primary drawable which is:
<itemize>
<item>the pixmap if ghostscript is drawing into a pixmap which was specified
	in the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ environment variable
<item>the destination window if the window does not have a backing pixmap
<item>the backing pixmap of the destination window if it has one.
</itemize>
This field is necessary to distinguish multiple ghostscripts rendering to
separate pixmaps when the <bf/GHOSTVIEW/ property was placed on the same
window.
The <bf/PAGE/ message indicates that a page has been completed;
ghostscript will wait until it receives a <tt/ClientMessage/ whose
<tt/message_type/ is <bf/NEXT/ before continuing.
The <bf/DONE/ message indicates that ghostscript has finished processing.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
