<H2><A NAME="ss30.1">30.1 The GHOSTVIEW Environment Variable</A>
</H2>

<P>When the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> environment variable is set, ghostscript draws on
an existing drawable rather than creating its own window; ghostscript
will draw in either a window or a pixmap depending on the contents
of this variable.
<P>The general form of the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> variable is
<PRE>
        window-id [pixmap-id]
</PRE>

where <B>window-id</B> is the identifier of the destination window
(<CODE>XtWindow(ghostview_widget)</CODE> for example) and the optional
<B>pixmap-id</B> value is the identifier for a pixmap to draw into; both values
are of type <B>XID</B> (32-bit unsigned integer).
If only a window is specified, ghostscript will draw into that window but
if the pixmap is also specified, all drawing will be done on the pixmap.
In both cases the window is used to determine the colormap, screen, and
visual to use; if the destination is a window, then the height and width will
be retrieved from the window, otherwise, the dimensions will be those of the
pixmap.
All remaining information is retrieved from the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> property on the
window (when drawing is done to a pixmap, this property is deleted when read).
Any events that ghostscript wishes to send will be directed at the window
specified in the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> environment variable.

<H2><A NAME="gv-win-prop"></A> <A NAME="ss30.2">30.2 The GHOSTVIEW Property</A>
</H2>

<P>The <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> property is of type <B>STRING</B> and should have the
form
<PRE>
        bpixmap orient llx lly urx ury xdpi ydpi [left bottom top right]
</PRE>

and a <B>scanf(3)</B> format of
<PRE>
        %d %d %d %d %d %d %f %f %d %d %d %d
</PRE>

The parameters are:
<DL>
<DT><B>bpixmap</B><DD><P>Pixmap id of the backing pixmap for the window.
If no pixmap is to be used, this parameter should be zero and this
parameter must be zero when the destination is a pixmap rather than
a window.
<P>
<DT><B>orient</B><DD><P>This should be a number representing the page orientation.
The value is the clockwise rotation of the paper in degrees;
only 0, 90, 180, and 270 are permitted 
<P>
<DT><B>llx, lly, urx, ury</B><DD><P>The bounding box of the drawable in <B>PostScript</B> points in the default user
coordinate system.
<P>
<DT><B>xdpi, ydpi</B><DD><P>These values specify the horizontal and vertical resolution of the
destination.
Even though these values may be computed from other parameters, they
are specified to avoid round-off errors.
<P>
<DT><B>left, bottom, top, right</B><DD><P>These optional parameters specify the margins around the window in
<B>PostScript</B> points; the margins extend the imageable area beyond the
boundaries of the window.
This is primarily used for popup zoom windows.
Some <B>PostScript</B> programs position themselves based on the imageable area
so these values are useful at times.
Any unspecified margins are assumed to be zero.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss30.3">30.3 Events from Ghostscript</A>
</H2>

<P>If the final destination is a pixmap, the client will get a property notify
event when ghostscript reads the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> property causing it to be
deleted.
<P>Ghostscript sends events to the window where it read the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> property;
these events are of type <B>ClientMessage</B> and the <B>message_type</B> is
set to either <B>PAGE</B> or <B>DONE</B>.
The first long data value specifies the window which is to be used when
sending replies to ghostscript; the second long data value specifies the
primary drawable which is:
<UL>
<LI>the pixmap if ghostscript is drawing into a pixmap which was specified
in the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> environment variable</LI>
<LI>the destination window if the window does not have a backing pixmap</LI>
<LI>the backing pixmap of the destination window if it has one.</LI>
</UL>

This field is necessary to distinguish multiple ghostscripts rendering to
separate pixmaps when the <B>GHOSTVIEW</B> property was placed on the same
window.
The <B>PAGE</B> message indicates that a page has been completed;
ghostscript will wait until it receives a <CODE>ClientMessage</CODE> whose
<CODE>message_type</CODE> is <B>NEXT</B> before continuing.
The <B>DONE</B> message indicates that ghostscript has finished processing.
