<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.1">22.1 Switches Pages Too Fast</A>
</H2>

<P>I have had bug reports about crashes when you change pages too fast.  I
have been able to reproduce the problem but I had to hold the <EM>PageDown</EM>
key down to trigger the bug.  I think I know what's going on but I'm still
thinking about the best way to fix the problem.  Since the bug only manifests
itself under extreme circumstances and since I've only had one bug report
about this, I'm not going to try and rush a fix out.  In the mean time,
you can avoid the problem by not holding the <EM>PageDown</EM> or <EM>PageUp</EM>
keys down, use the page list instead.  My apologies if this causes anyone
grief.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.2">22.2 Modal Dialogs</A>
</H2>

<P><B>mgv</B> has no modal dialogs (even the <EM>overwrite confirmation</EM> dialog
in <EM>File/Save...</EM> is modeless); modal dialogs are evil.  This really
means that dialogs don't stop you from doing other things in the application:
you don't have to back out of a dialog to change something and bring the
dialog back--you just go and change things without leaving your current
dialog.
For people that have lived too long under the tyranny of modal dialogs
this may be confusing.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="caveats-antialias"></A> <A NAME="ss22.3">22.3 Anti-aliasing</A>
</H2>

<P>The anti-aliasing support in newer versions of Ghostscript (version 3.33 GNU and
higher) is a mixed blessing.
For text documents, especially those produced by <B>dvips</B> from TeX DVI
documents, the readability advantages are wonderful and easily overshadow
the performance penalties (which aren't that noticeable with text anyway);
however, anti-aliasing delivers a noticeable performance penalty on graphics
and can actually make the images look worse, anti-aliasing can also seriously
degrade any document which uses a lot of colors when viewed on an eight-bit
display.
If you find this happening to you, try using the <B>antialiasEPS</B> resource
(or the <EM>-aliaseps</EM> and <EM>-noaliaseps</EM> switches) to change the 
anti-aliasing of EPS files.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.4">22.4 Non-DSC and PDF Documents</A>
</H2>

<P>If the document does not begin with <CODE>%!PS-Adobe-</CODE>, it does not
claim conformance to the document structuring convention; the functionality
of <B>mgv</B> is severely limited when dealing with non-DSC conformant
documents--about all you can do is move to the next page.
Also, zooming in a non-DSC document will always display the first page.
Since I haven't implemented a PDF parser, PDF files are effectively
treated as non-DSC documents so that <B>mgv</B> is quite limited when viewing
PDF files (xpdf or Adobe's Acroread are much better for PDF files).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.5">22.5 Broken Windows PostScript Drivers</A>
</H2>

<P>Some <B>PostScript</B> documents produced by the MS-Windows <B>PostScript</B> drivers will cause
erroneous warnings about a lack of virtual memory.
When trying to view such documents, you will only get a page telling you
that you don't have enough memory in your printer and some steps (which will
probably be useless if you don't have the original document) to correct the
problem.
A simple hack to fix this problem is to find a line that looks like
<PRE>
        30000 VM?
</PRE>

and remove it.
The following perl filter should fix such documents:
<PRE>
        perl -pe 's/^(\d+\s+VM\?\r?)$/% \1/'
</PRE>

Thanks to Bart Robinson (<CODE>lomew@cs.utah.edu</CODE>) in comp.lang.postscript
for this advice.
<P>Windows printer drivers for <B>PostScript</B> also tend to produce incorrect DSC comments.
The Windows PostScript driver builds the <B>NTPSOct94</B> dictionary which
contains various functions; the required <CODE>NTPSOct94 begin</CODE> command appears
between the <CODE>%%EndSetup</CODE> comment and the first
<CODE>%%Page</CODE> comment so that neither <B>mgv</B> or Ghostview will pass
<CODE>NTPSOct94 begin</CODE> to Ghostscript.  The simplest solution is to change
<PRE>
        %%EndSetup
        NTPSOct94 begin
        %%Page: 1 1
</PRE>

to
<PRE>
        NTPSOct94 begin
        %%EndSetup
        %%Page: 1 1
</PRE>

in the offending document (this is will leave your <B>PostScript</B> file <EM>less</EM>
broken rather than fixed).
A better solution--which the NT <B>PostScript</B> driver should probably be
doing--is to remove the offending &quot;<CODE>NTPSOct94 begin</CODE>&quot;
command and add &quot;<CODE>NTPSOct94 begin</CODE>&quot; at the beginning of
each page and add an &quot;<CODE>end</CODE>&quot; at the end of each page.
The following perl script should perform this transformation on its standard
input and print the fixed file to its standard output:
<PRE>
        #!/usr/local/bin/perl
        $first_page = 1;
        $bogus      = "";
        while($line = &lt;STDIN>) {
                ##
                ## Skip NT's brain damage (at least a little teeny tiny
                ## part of it)
                ##
                if($line =~ /^NTPSOct9[45] begin/) {
                        $bogus = $line;
                        next;
                }

                ##
                ## Insert appropriate begin/end pairs
                ##
                if($first_page &amp;&amp; $line =~ /%%Page:/) {
                        print $line, $bogus;
                        $first_page = 0;
                }
                elsif($line =~ /%%Page:/) {
                        print "end\n", $line, $bogus;
                }
                elsif($line =~ /%%Trailer/) {
                        print "end\n$line";
                        # next line is the "end" that we want to kill
                        $line = &lt;STDIN>;
                }
                else {
                        print $line;
                }
        }
        exit(0);
</PRE>

The same problem occurs with the <B>NTPSOct95</B> version of the <B>PostScript</B> driver
but the above script should deal with that one too.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.6">22.6 DSC Parsing Problems</A>
</H2>

<P>The current DSC parser doesn't like Mac files (which use a single carriage
return as end-of-line); if you want to view such files, change the
carriage returns to line feeds with something like this:
<PRE>
        perl -pe 's/\r/\n/g' &lt; mac-file > unix-file
</PRE>

and try again.  I could attempt to fix the DSC parser but I'd rather not
touch it until I have time to build a cleaner one.
<P>Files with a PageOrder of <B>Special</B> will confuse the DSC parser--pages
will be lost or out of order.  If you have to deal with such files, you'll
have to use another viewer until I can rewrite the DSC parser.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.7">22.7 Application Defaults Version Problems</A>
</H2>

<P>The application defaults file specifies a significant portion of <B>mgv</B>'s
behavior; hence, an incorrect application defaults file can cause many
problems.  If <B>mgv</B> warns you about an incorrect version number, you
should fix it--setting the 
<A HREF="mgv-19.html#appres-applicationVersion">applicationVersion</A> will not fix the problem, it will only
make the warning go away.
<P>The correct version of the application defaults file should be installed
in the same place as the documentation (look for a file called <CODE>MGv</CODE>)
so you can fix the problem by running <B>mgv</B> like this:
<PRE>
        XENVIRONMENT=/path/to/mgv/library/files/MGv mgv
</PRE>

until the local administrator can fix the problem by removing the old
application defaults file.  This problem should only be encountered by
people that started with <B>mgv</B> version 1.x.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.8">22.8 Non-Default Visuals on Irix 5.3</A>
</H2>

<P>I have had reports of problems with non-default visuals under Irix 5.3
when the root window has depth eight.  Everything works fine with Irix 6.2/6.4
and other systems.  Private colormaps do work with Irix 5.3 so all is not
lost.  As near as I can tell, this is a bug somewhere in SGI's Motif libraries
and I don't know how to work around the problem.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss22.9">22.9 Reporting Bugs</A>
</H2>

<P>If you find any bugs in <B>mgv</B> please send a bug report to <CODE>mu@trends.net</CODE>
which includes the following information:
<UL>
<LI><B>mgv</B> version number</LI>
<LI>operating system name and release number</LI>
<LI>Motif and X versions</LI>
<LI>Ghostscript version</LI>
<LI>clear and concise instructions to reproduce the bug (include sample
<B>PostScript</B> files if possible)</LI>
<LI>anything else that may be relevant</LI>
</UL>

The information in the build options dialog
(see 
<A HREF="mgv-11.html#help-bldopts">Build Options Dialog</A>) may be useful
as well.  If you can fix the bug, a patch would be appreciated but please
bear in mind that the author is somewhat fanatical about maintaining a
consistent coding/naming style in the code so patches may be reformatted
and/or torn apart before they get into the code.
<P>I will try and respond to all bug reports quickly (where <EM>quickly</EM> is a
function of how detailed the report is and how easy it is for me to
reproduce) but don't be surprised if it takes me a few days to respond.
<P>
