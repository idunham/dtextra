This is a bunch of "extras" you may enjoy using with OpenCDE.
It is assumed that you will have OpenMotif, OpenCDE, and so on
installed; any additional dependencies should be documented here.

Xlt is included with Lesstif, but not regular Motif versions.

CHANGES
Sept 4
-MoxFM has been dropped due to its UI, instability on my own system, and the
availability of a better file manager: xplore
-Xplore 1.2a has been added, with 2 externs changed to make it build on new 
systems (tested on Debian Squeeze)
-Xg is included in Xplore 1.2a
-Tarball removal
-mppp1.1b *.tmpl previously updated to avoid XmClientLibs issue
-makefile tweaks in dt{scan,exec}
-patches/ added

NOTES:
xmkmf -a (or xmkmf; make Makefiles; make depends) will set up imake-based
software.  Edit *.tmpl to configure the installation.
"find ./|grep config.cache|xargs rm" is a good idea before running configure;
otherwise you may end up configuring for Debian on a BSD system,
or rather getting failed compiles for half the software
Be sure to run xmkmf or configure before running make, if the software
uses such a framework.
I'm considering a .cpio.bz2/xz archive, to save space; feel free to comment.
patches/ contains several old patches for OpenCDE, which may be useful or may
not work.  I included dtrun, the dtsplash -s <seconds> patch, & the battery 
status patches (with scripts)



TODO:
./Makefile
(targets: configure [PREFIX] all clean install [PREFIX DESTDIR] tarball)
Copy in the FWF distribution?
Add dt{auth,mount,wifi}?
